Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Clinical studies have shown that inhaled iloprost has comparable pulmonary hemodynamic effects to INO and inhaled prostacyclin (69) . It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for pulmonary hypertension with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. We currently use INO and inhaled iloprost as rescue therapies for patients with severe ARDS and hypoxemia.\n\n Another vasodilatory prostaglandin, alprostadil, has also been shown to allow improvements similar to those of INO when delivered by aerosol to patients with ARDS (70, 71) . These results suggest that aerosolized prostacyclin or similar drugs could be viable therapeutic alternatives to INO. Additionally prostacyclin may have some advantages over NO because it is easier to administer and has harmless metabolites; however, it is more expensive and has not shown any survival benefit in human trials.\n\n In patients with acute and severe respiratory failure and ARDS that do not respond to any advanced modes of mechanical ventilation, the use of ECLS or ECMO is an option. ECLS is a proven modality for treatment of severe respiratory failure in the neonate (72, 73) and use has increased since its inception (74) . For infants, children, and adults with severe ARDS, ECLS therapy has produced survival rates of 85%, 74%, and 52%, respectively (75) . The indications for ECLS for adult respiratory failure are listed in Table 1 . Referral to an ECLS center should occur early if need for this technology is suspected. This will allow safe patient transport and avoidance of the \"crash on,\" with all of its inherent complications.\n\n The technique of ECLS for patients with severe respiratory failure involves a veno-venous or veno-arterial life support circuit with a membrane oxygenator to temporarily take over the lung functions. Mechanical ventilator settings are ad-justed to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and to maximize the recruitment to functional residual capacity. The treatment program for adults involves an algorithm that aims to normalize body physiology, aggressively recruit functional residual capacity, and minimize barotrauma. This algorithm, used in 141 patients with respiratory failure referred for consideration of ECLS, yielded a survival rate of 62% in patients with severe ARDS (median initial PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, 66) (76).\n\n The primary indication for ECLS in patients with severe respiratory failure is when the risk of dying of ARDS is considered \u03fe80% despite optimal ventilator and medical management. This translates to an alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient \u03fe600 mm Hg or a PaO 2 -to-FIO 2 ratio of \u03fd70 on 100% oxygen.\n\n The majority of patients with severe ARDS are managed with veno-venous ECMO. Adult patients are typically cannulated percutaneously with 21-F to 23-F catheters for drainage and infusion of blood. Veno-arterial access is used to provide respiratory and hemodynamic support for patients in shock (as may be the case in some H1N1 patients). Anticoagulation is necessary and is titrated by measurement of whole blood activated clotting time and/or serial partial thromboplastin time. ECLS allows for a decrease in mechanical ventilator settings to nondamaging \"rest\" levels while maintaining functional residual capacity recruitment measures. Once the patient's native lung function has improved, a trial off ECLS is attempted at moderate ventilatory settings that allow for potential increases in therapy (e.g., FIO 2 , 0.5-0.6). If the trial of ECLS is successful, the cannulae are removed and the recovery continues.\n\n In a series of 255 adult patients who were placed on ECLS for severe ARDS refractory to all other treatment strategies, 67% were weaned off ECLS, and 52% survived to hospital discharge (77) . Multivariate analysis identified the following pre-ECLS variables as significant independent predictors of survival: (1) age; (2) gender; (3) arterial blood pH \u05457.10; (4) PaO 2 -to-FIO 2 ratio; and (5) days of mechanical ventilation.

In a study where 25 patients with CSFP were administered dipyridamole 75 mg three times a day for one month, coronary flow returned to normal in 70 out of 75 vessels. Typical angina complaints resolved in 17 patients (68%), and decreased in frequency in the remaining 8 patients (32%) [24] . Dipyridamole abolishes functional obstruction in coronary arteries with diameters less than 200 micrometers and is considered far superior in treating CSFP as compared to nitroglycerine [24] .\n\n There is no substantial data regarding the use of conventional calcium L-channel blockers such as amlodipine in patients with CSFP. It was used in the second case as described above because calcium channel blockers are macro-and microvascular vasodilators used for slow flow during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In one study regarding clinical and angiographic benefits of the calcium T-channel blocker mibefradil in CSFP patients, results showed reduction of total angina frequency by 56%, prolonged angina episodes > 20 minutes by 74%, and sublingual nitroglycerine consumption by 59% over a 12-month period. Angiographically, 13 out of 18 vessels showing TIMI-2 flow had abolition of the slow flow [25] . Currently, its use is limited due to occurrence of extensive drug interactions by inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway [26] .\n\n An important differential to be considered in the diagnosis of CSFP is coronary syndrome X. Over the last few years, a number of important distinguishing features between these two seemingly similar entities have been identified (Table 2) . In a study of 49 patients, Atak et al. documented increased QTc dispersion in patients with CSFP, which greatly increases the predisposition of sudden cardiac death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias [27] . CSFP has also been termed as syndrome Y because of its interesting occurrence in syndrome X patients, after administration of neuropeptide Y [28] .\n\n The major long-term problem in CSFP patients is persistent and recurrent chest pain. One-third of these patients require readmission for an acute exacerbation [32] . In a study of 88 patients with angina and normal coronary arteries over a followup period of 6-11 years, chest pain diminished in 47%, and symptoms were unchanged in 24% or even worse in 29% of patients. However, 81% of patients with documented CSFP at coronary angiography reported chest pain to be similar or even worse than the initial episode [33] .\n\n Resting EKG abnormalities and positive exercise stress tests are more frequent in patients with CSFP. In one study of 53 patients with angina and angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries and 40% having documented CSFP, 57% of patients had worsening or persistence of symptoms, and nonsignificant resting EKG abnormalities were seen in 27% while exercise-induced functional and perfusion abnormalities occurred in 69% of patients [34] .\n\n Patients with CSFP have a favorable long-term prognosis as reported by Lichtlen et al. in a prospective study of 176 patients with angina and normal coronary arteries. The median followup time period was 12.4 years. The rate of fatal myocardial infarction was found to be 0.05% per year, risk of death from coronary artery disease was 0.09% per year, and the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction occurrence was 0.18% per year [35] .\n\n The major implications of this disease entity are reflected in the hampering of day-to-day life of CSFP patients with persistent chest pain and multiple hospital admissions. This is highlighted particularly well in the two cases presented here.

Patients are allocated to treatment as in a biased coin design, that is, allocated to one treatment arm with probability P, however, the value of P is determined based on the outcomes of patients previously enrolled in the study. If a treatment effect is observed, the value of P changes to allow patients a better opportunity of receiving the treatment with the best results. Over the course of the trial, this allocation method aims to optimise patient outcomes and more patients will receive the superior treatment.\n\n A number of points should be considered when selecting an allocation method for use in a particular trial. For example, trials implementing DA methods must have sufficient statistical and programming support available to prevent avoidable algorithm and programming errors. An accessible and reliable centralised database is required for investigators to register patients and to perform the treatment allocation. Depending on the trial, this database may need to be coordinated with centre pharmacies or companies shipping treatment to the study centre. While this support is likely available within most large, cooperative groups, Statistical issues when using dynamic allocation methods GR Pond it may be less accessible in smaller centres or companies doing only a limited number of clinical trials. The cost and time required to develop these systems may not be feasible or viable given the small savings in sample size afforded by a balanced trial (Senn, 2004) . Alternatively, for very expensive novel therapies, a small savings in sample size could be financially advantageous, particularly if many of the systems are already in place. One might additionally consider potential imbalances in costs between individual study centres if discrepancies were to occur in the number of patients receiving each treatment at different sites. This might occur when there are differences in supportive care costs or in the number of follow-up visits -especially if a costly imaging procedure is included at each follow-up -between treatment arms. Scientifically, the number and importance of known prognostic factors should factor in the decision of which allocation method to use. If the number and effect on the outcome of prognostic factors is large relative to the total trial sample size, preventing an imbalance might be of greater concern than a trial with few prognostic factors, which has only a modest effect on the outcome and a large sample size. The selection of method to use might be affected if some prognostic factors have a greater effect on outcome than others. Alternatively, one might be concerned with and choose an allocation algorithm based on the issue of selection bias, which might arise in an open-label trial or when the comparison treatments are extremely dissimilar (e.g., surgery vs non-surgical therapies). Selection bias arises when investigators can guess with improved probability the treatment future patients will be assigned to receive. Although concerning for deterministic algorithms when physicians know the characteristics of previous patients enrolled, the ability to guess assignment for future patients becomes negligible when centre is not used in the algorithm scheme or a random probability is included in the algorithm (Brown et al, 2005) .\n\n Finally, one must think about the ultimate analysis and conclusions that might be inferred from a particular trial. Is it likely a sceptic will discount a result if an imbalance is present? Do investigators have sufficient statistical support to address any potential inferential concerns if they are raised? If the trial is being conducted in preparation for a regulatory submission, have the authorities provided any guidance? As recently as 2003, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products noted that DA methods remained highly controversial and strongly advised against their use (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, 2003) . Their concern is driven by logistical and practical flaws in previous applications using DA methods, and due to theoretical concerns (Day et al, 2005) . Although one certainly does not want to use DA methods which could prove problematic if there is no perceived benefit (Day et al, 2005) , the logistical and practical concerns can be addressed with proper algorithmic testing and attention (Buyse and McEntegart, 2004a) . Of greater issue is the theoretical concerns which results from the fact that standard statistical analysis techniques are based on random allocation methods and DA methodology is not random. The distribution of possible outcomes depends on the allocation method used. Consequently, P-values obtained using tests which assume random allocation will not be correct when a DA algorithm was used. To illustrate the extent of this potential problem, an example is provided in the next section.\n\n Assume eight patients are allocated as part of a clinical trial to one of two treatment arms, as illustrated in Table 2 .", "qa": [["59_16259233_2_1", "What are some factors to consider when selecting an allocation method for a clinical trial?", "When selecting an allocation method for a clinical trial, several factors should be considered.

In 2015, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association advised in a guideline for health care professionals: \"When a patient is considered for repair of an aneurysm, patient age, presence of medical comorbidities, and aneurysm location and size should be taken into careful consideration.\" 14 There is agreement among health care professionals that the location and size of UIAs are among key prognostic factors for future rupture, and therefore authors of risk prediction models and treatment guidelines have tried to categorize the risk by these factors. In 2014, a simple PHASES score was created for prediction of future rupture. 1 According to the score, the 5-year absolute risk of rupture was minimal (~ 1%) for people younger than 70 years with small (< 10 mm) anterior circulation UIAs, even when these people had a history of hypertension and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). 1 If one-quarter of all UIAs rupture in a lifetime, 6 and the risk of rupture of small (< 10 mm) anterior circulation UIAs is minimal, 1 the majority of RIAs are presumably large (\u2265 10 mm). Due to the lack of large consecutive series of patients with RIAs, the proportion of small and large RIAs is unknown.\n\n To estimate population-wide effects of any prevention strategy, which is based on risk categories, the proportion of events in each risk category has to be known. With regard to risk prediction models, which are used as tools to assess whether preventive interventions of UIAs are warranted, the proportion of RIAs in reported risk categories could not have been taken into consideration. Therefore, our aim was to define the location and size of saccular ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) in a consecutive series of a large number of patients admitted to a nonprofit, public, and academic center between 1995 and 2009.\n\n The design of this study was approved by the local ethics committee.\n\n Since 1937, cases involving patients admitted to the Helsinki University Hospital with intracranial aneurysms have been recorded in the Aneurysm Registry of the Department of Neurosurgery. The latest risk prediction model, the PHASES score, 1 included patients diagnosed with SAH between 1992 and 2013 (annual incidence rates reported after first recruitments in 1991, maximum followup of 15 years). The data from more than 7000 patients in our registry were limited to consecutive patients diagnosed with SAH between January 1995 and August 2009, as this time period covers well the studies included in the PHASES score.\n\n 1 Furthermore, until the end of 2009, the vast majority of RIAs were treated surgically, enabling us to include patients with multiple aneurysms (the rupture site being confirmed in surgery) in the study cohort.\n\n During the study period, 2191 patients were diagnosed with SAH caused by a saccular RIA. Of the 2191 patients, 65 patients were diagnosed with RIAs at autopsy (no angiographic studies before death), and 3 patients in surgery (no evident aneurysms in angiographic studies). For 4 patients with kidney insufficiency, RIAs were diagnosed using MR angiography. Comprehensive data from imaging studies and sizes of RIAs were available for 1993 patients, in whom RIAs were detected with CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). If a SAH patient underwent both DSA and CTA, DSA measurements were used in reporting the size of RIA.\n\n The diagnosis of SAH was made if lumbar punctures and/or CT scans revealed blood in the subarachnoid space. DSA and CTA studies were used to define the multiplicity, site, and size of RIAs. Overall, 85% of the cohort patients underwent CTA or 4-vessel DSA. Imaging studies were re-reviewed by one of the study neurosurgeons (R.K.), who is also a qualified radiologist.

Probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 have been previously shown to be useful as adjuvants in the treatment of women with VVC. In order to demonstrate and better understand the anti-Candida activity of the probiotic microorganisms in an in vitro model simulating vaginal candidiasis, a human vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2/E6E7) was infected with C.albicans 3153a and then challenged with probiotic L. rhamnosus GR-1 and/or L. reuteri RC-14 or their respective CFS (alone or in combination). At each time point (0, 6, 12 and 24 hr), numbers of yeast, lactobacilli and viable VK2/E6E7 cells were determined and, at 0, 6 and 12 hr, the supernatants were measured for cytokine levels. We found that C. albicans induced a significant increase in IL-1alpha and IL-8 production by VK2/E6E7 cells. After lactobacilli challenge, epithelial cells did not alter IL-6, IL-1alpha, RANTES and VEGF levels. However, CFS from the probiotic microorganisms up-regulated IL-8 and IP-10 levels secreted by VK2/E6E7 cells infected with C. albicans. At 24 hr of co-incubation, L. reuteri RC-14 alone and in combination with L. rhamnosus GR-1 decreased the yeast population recoverable from the cells. Symptoms related to vulvitis and vulvovaginitis are a frequent complaint in the paediatric age. Knowledge of the risk factors and the pathogenetic mechanisms, combined with thorough clinical examination, helps to distinguish between dermatological diseases, non-specific vulvitis and vulvovaginitis proper. On the basis of microbiological data, the most common pathogens prove to be Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobius vermicularis; fungal and viral infections are less frequent. The possibility of isolating opportunistic pathogens should also be considered. In rare situations, the isolation of a micro-organism normally transmitted by sexual contact should prompt a careful evaluation of possible sexual abuse. Current treatments for specific and non-specific forms are outlined, together with pointers for the evaluation of recurrence. BACKGROUND: Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory T cell-driven sclerotic skin condition in which skin barrier disruption frequently occurs. Inflamed and injured epithelia are a particularly rich source of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs).

The focus has been on the laboratory properties of the materials and adhesives used for bonding tubes to molar teeth.\n\n 10-13 Prospective randomized clinical trials 2, 6 are an exception and essentially involve children and adolescents.\n\n By comparing the overall survival rate of banded molars (69.49%) with that of bonded molars (71.18%) in adults, the results of this study revealed a survival rate that was not statistically different (p = 0.97). The failure rate in both alternatives was found to be similar, i.e., 30.5% (banded molars) vs. 28.8% (bonded molars). However, either procedure showed a higher rate of failure in the lower arch (p = 0.01).\n\n The failure rate of bonded molar tubes in the present study (28.8%) was similar to what was observed in retrospective studies (14.8-29 .5%), 8, [14] [15] [16] [17] and in a prospective study with adolescents (18.4-33.7%). 2, 6 A previous study 18 in which a single operator bonded all teeth showed that young patients (aged < 18 years) had a greater risk than old ones (aged > 18 years) and that there was no significant difference in failure when first molars are compared to second molars. In old and young patients, failure rates of molar tubes were 5.2% and 15.3%, respectively. As regards the relative similarity in the success rate of bonding compared to previous randomized studies, 2, 6 a marked difference was found in the failure rate between banded molars, 2.6% 2 and 18.8% 6 , and the 30.5% found in this study. These differences may have been due to the materials used in these studies. It is more likely, however, that the different experience of each operator exercised a major influence on the whole process, as reported by a previous study that analyzed the bonding of molar tubes. 8 As to banding, this finding seems to be intimately associated with moisture control, which is vital for the manipulation of glass ionomer cements used in the present study. In addition, orthodontic residents usually work without a chairside assistant, which impairs moisture control during banding and bonding procedures. Previous studies have also shown that the operator affects the bond strength of molar tubes. 2, 8 Despite the fact that the survival graph for upper and lower molars has shown a similar behavior between bonded and banded molars (p = 0.97), when the results are analyzed separately by dental arch, the bonding (81.25%) and banding (71.87%) techniques seem to exhibit greater strength in the maxillary vs.", "qa": [["54_12071630_1_1", "What are the advantages of bonding attachments for posterior teeth in orthodontic treatment?\n", "Bonding attachments for posterior teeth in orthodontic treatment have several advantages.

Among these factors are estrogens and progestogens, ovarian hormones with profound effects on many tissues and organs, including the brain. These effects include the regulation of non-reproductive processes such as perception, cognition, mood, and motor control.\n\n On 28-29 September 2004, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the United States (US) National Institutes of Health convened scientists from basic science, epidemiology, and clinical trials fields for a workshop held in Bethesda, MD. Cosponsors for the workshop, entitled \"Bench to Bedside: Estrogen as a Case Study\" were the National Institute of Mental Health, Office of Research on Women's Health, and the Alzheimer's Association. The focus of the workshop was on scientific data concerning the use of estrogens and progestogens in the aging female brain: what is already known and what will be required to translate discoveries from the laboratory workbench, from epidemiology, and from clinical trials into everyday medical practice.\n\n Defined workshop objectives were the following: (1) to examine apparent discrepancies between the findings of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) on brain and cognitive function after estrogen and progestogen treatment, and basic research and epidemiological studies, which have often differed in terms of the formulations, doses and modes of administration, and in terms of treatment timing and duration of the hormone therapy (HT) employed; (2) to examine effects of estrogen and progestogen on brain and cognitive function in relation to aging; (3) to determine what is known and what information would be needed to establish whether additional hormone interventions could be developed in this area; and (4) to determine the lessons learned from studies on estrogen that might guide the design of clinical trials for other classes of drugs that might affect cognitive aging. The workshop agenda with abstracts and presentations is available on-line at http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ ExtramuralPrograms/NeuroscienceOfAging/NNA_ Conferences/WorkshopAgendaAbsPres.htm; summary notes can be found at http://www.nia.nih.gov/Research Information/ExtramuralPrograms/NeuroscienceOf Aging/NNA_Conferences/WorkshopSummaryNotes. htm.\n\n Following the workshop, participants joined by other interested scientists organized into regional work groups to continue the dialogue begun in Bethesda and to propose recommendations for NIA. One venue for ongoing discussion was the biennial Graylyn Conference on Women's Cognitive Health, co-sponsored by the NIA and hosted by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Meetings in October 2005 and October 2007 focused on translational research and included many participants from the Bethesda Bench to Bedside workshop.\n\n The regional work group recommendations are described below as the Frontiers Proposal for Estrogen and Cognitive Aging, implying that there remain frontiers for discoveries concerning estrogen and other sex steroids in relation to the aging brain, cognition, and cognitive disorders. The following sections provide background information, consensus recommendations by work group members, a concluding perspective, and an executive summary.\n\n \n\n Central nervous system consequences of menopausal estrogen and progesterone loss is an area of intense study, because many actions of these sex steroids are potentially relevant to cognitive aging and dementia. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that estrogen protects against a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative insults, a substantial number of which are linked to AD. A key finding relevant to the development of AD is the ability of estrogen to reduce formation of \u03b2-amyloid (Petanceska et al. 2000; Yue et al. 2005) , a hallmark biochemical marker of this illness. Moreover, estrogen promotes both morphological and electrophysiological correlates of learning and memory in vitro and in vivo (Brinton et al. 1997; Hao et al. 2006; Murphy and Segal 1996; Toran-Allerand et al. 1980; Woolley and McEwen 1992) . Myriad neurotransmitter systems relevant to cognition (acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, glutamate) are regulated by estrogen. Studies in adult and aged non-human primates have revealed both behavioral and neurobiological effects of estrogen, some of which counter the effects of normal aging on cognition (Hao et al. 2006; Rapp et al. 2003a, b; Tinkler et al. 2004; Voytko 2002) . Overall, basic science analyses using both in vitro and in vivo model systems indicated that estrogentypically 17\u03b2-estradiol but also conjugated equine estrogens-protect neurons against insults associated with AD (Brinton 2005) .", "qa": [["18_6521824_0_1", "What are some potential effects of estrogen on cognitive aging and dementia?\n", "Estrogen has been found to protect against neurodegenerative insults and reduce the formation of \u03b2-amyloid, a biochemical marker of Alzheimer's disease.

In this position they lie just under the diaphragma sellae and may cause it to necrose (Forrest, 1959, personal communication) . Rhinorrhoea can, however, occur with properly placed rods and Forrest suggests that it is then due to overdosage, but this does not explain the immediate leak of cerebrospinal fluid which we have noticed on several occasions on the introduction of the cannula low down near the floor of the fossa. The cause, therefore, probably lies in abnormal anatomy and there are two variations from the normal which may be important.\n\n Firstly, the depth of the fossa, as shown radiologically, does not necessarily indicate the size of the gland which it contains (Fig. 3) . The pituitary may sometimes consist of no more than a flattened disc (Fig. 4) lying on the floor, and in such a case, the diaphragma is not stretched across the top but dips down to be closely applied to the upper surface of the gland. It is easy to see, therefore, that a rod placed in the middle of the fossa and judged to be in the middle of the gland, might in fact be lying above the diaphragma in the subarachnoid space.\n\n Secondly, the diaphragma sellae is often deficient. Mahmoud (1958) found this to be so in forty of one hundred fossae examined at autopsy. Sometimes the deficiency is quite large and it is in such cases that the subarachnoid space may extend down into the fossa.\n\n The assessment of the results of hypophysectomy is difficult. In many cases, the disease is apparently arrested no new lesions appearing, but without any signs of healing of the original ones. In some patients marked subjective improvement occurred with no evidence of any objective remission. It was decided, therefore, only to assess those cases who have shown definite objective remissions but this does not include '\" arrest\" of the disease. Many patients die from their disease within a short time of operation and these cannot, therefore, be assessed but in order to give an accurate picture of the series of 100 cases they have been included, and no case has been removed from the series on the grounds that it has been impossible to evaluate the patient, either because they have been lost to follow-up, or, because they died too soon. All complications are included and any death in which it is doubtful whether it was the result of the operation, has, nevertheless, been included in the series. In addition to this, no patient was refuised treatment, either because they were unfit for operation, or because it was considered that the disease was too advanced. The results, therefore, must be considered to be as complete as possible.\n\n Only two patients are alive, although twelve (11 -198Au, 1-90Y) had objective evidence of regression and one of these survives 44 months after implant. The remainder lived from periods ranging from 7 to 40 months, with an average survival of 19.4 months. The survival of the 88 patients who did not respond is shown (Fig. 5 ) 65 were dead in six months and 13 lived for less than one month. The few who lived for relatively long periods reminid one how chronlic this disease can be.\n\n In 5 cases only was pituitary implantation performed as the first planned treatment. Thirty-seven of the patients had had previous endocrine surgery, either oophorectomy alone, or combined with adrenalectomy. None of them showed improvement after pituitary implantation no matter what their response to the previous operation had been. This is not surprising in those cases treated by adrenalectomy, as response to pituitary ablation is unusual after this operation. There was only one case that had relapsed after successful oophorectomy, and pituitary implantation failed to induce further regression. It is obvious that no reasonable comparison can be made of the results in this series with those obtained by other methods of treatment.\n\n Apart from routine blood examinations and radiological surveys of the skeleton, the following investigations were carried out on these patients: It is not the purpose of this paper to analyse in detail the results of I-hese investigations, but some important points are noted. The estimation of gonadotrophin excretion in the urine is the only satisfactory test available at present for the measurement of pituitary function. The levels in premenopausal women tend to be low.

Complete linkage clustering was performed using an open source development software project, bioconductor, ver 1.9, for the analysis of microarray expression data with the uncentered correlation similarity metric.\n\n Standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for clusters of patients with similar patterns of oncogenic pathway deregulation using GraphPad Prism Software, version 4.03. Differences in survival were tested for statistical significance using a two-sided log-rank test using GraphPad Prism Software, version 4.03. This test generates a two-tailed P value testing the null hypothesis, which is that the survival curves are identical in the overall populations. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the populations have no differences in disease-free survival.\n\n Individual differences in the probability of oncogenic pathway deregulation between women aged #45 years and $65 years were analyzed via the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test using Graph Pad Prism Software, version 4.03. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results were validated via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) methodology (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/). GSEA is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states [17] .\n\n Finally, chemotherapy sensitivity patterns were assessed across groups of patients defined by both pathway clusters and age (#45 years and $65 years). Linear regression analyses were performed to ascertain correlations where indicated, using Graph Pad Prism Software, version 4.03.\n\n Our goal was to determine if cluster (of oncogenic pathway deregulation) designation was independently significant when controlling for known clinico-pathologic variables in the prediction of disease-free survival in early stage breast cancer. A disease-free survival event was defined as the time from diagnosis to recurrence or death, whichever occurred first, and was censored at time of last follow-up for those who were alive. Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards regression modeling was used to predict disease-free survival when considering each age cohort separately. The clinicopathologic variables considered included: age at breast cancer diagnosis, ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status by immunohistochemistry or enzyme immunoassay (IHC or EIA, positive vs. negative), Her2 by IHC (0, 1+, 2+ vs. 3+), tumor grade (1, 2 vs. 3), tumor size (#2 cm vs. .2 cm), and lymph node status (positive vs. negative). The dataset with clinico-pathologic variables was excellent for imputing missing values due to high correlations among the variables. For multivariate modeling SAS proc MI was used to impute missing clinico-pathologic data for variables with less than 50% missing values. For this reason, PR and Her2 were excluded from all multivariate models. Multivariate models used the backward selection technique and an alpha of 0.50 [18] .\n\n \n\n Clinico-pathologic and demographic data including age at diagnosis, ER status, lymph node status, and tumor size, with corresponding gene expression data were available for patients in all four datasets. PR and Her2 status were available only in the Duke and CODEX datasets, respectively. A detailed description of the clinico-pathologic and demographic information for all patients included in the study is shown in Supplementary Table S2 [12] .\n\n The power of gene expression profiling is the ability to understand biology beyond what may be apparent from the study of clinical variables or individual gene markers. Nevertheless, the interpretation of large-scale expression data can be a significant challenge. We have described an alternative approach that makes use of expression signatures of oncogenic signaling pathways that can be used to profile the status of oncogenic pathways in a collection of biological samples, including human tumors.\n\n Using the previously described signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation, patterns of pathway deregulation in 200 breast tumor samples arising in young women aged #45 years were evaluated. Hierarchical clustering revealed clear patterns of oncogenic pathway deregulation defining five main clusters ( Figure 1A ). Analysis of disease-free survival of patients identified by these clusters revealed clinically-significant distinctions as a function of the pattern.

By Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit CX 3 CR1 antibody, a 50-kDa protein was detected in washed human platelets and was comparable with PBMCs and human spleen lysate, which are well known to express CX 3 CR1 ( Figure  1A) .

Furthermore, inhibition of G-protein-coupled, receptor-mediated signaling using PTX completely abolished fractalkine-elicited platelet activation ( Figure 2B ).\n\n When platelets were preincubated with apyrase, surface expression of P-selectin by fractalkine was significantly reduced, suggesting that presence of ADP enhanced the platelet-activating stimulus of fractalkine.

For example, the concentrations of acetate and propionate gradually increased from day 7 onward, being those detected at day 28 significantly higher than those at day 7. It is worth noting that the concentration of n-butyrate was barely detected from day 7 to day 28 after birth ( Figure 1l ).\n\n Age at weaning also tended to affect SCFA concentrations in the abdominal vein after weaning. For example, after weaning at day 21, the concentration of acetate initially tended to increase (W21p7), before showing a tendency to decrease at day 14 post-weaning (W21p14). In contrast, after weaning at day 28 a decrease in the concentration of acetate was detected, which by day 14 post-weaning (W28p14) became significant, when compared with S28 piglets. In addition, the concentration of propionate tended to decrease in piglets weaned at days 21 and 28. Regarding the concentration of n-butyrate, a non-significant increase was detected in all weaned piglets, regardless of age at weaning.\n\n Gene expression of SCFA transporters MCT1 and SMCT1, and occludin-a molecule related to the tight junction-is shown in Figure 2 . While the gene expression of MCT1 decreased during suckling, it increased after weaning (Figure 2a) . Indeed, there were significant differences between the gene expression of MCT1 observed at weaning days and after weaning (S21 vs. W21p7, W21p14, and W28p7). The highest expression of smct1 was detected in S14 piglets (Figure 2b ). In addition, smct1 expression showed non-significant increases after weaning at days 21 and 28. Gene expression of occludin was the highest in S7 piglets, but it decreased over time (Figure 2c ). While a significant difference was observed between S7 and S21 piglets, weaning did not affect the gene expression of occludin. \n\n Correlations of the concentrations of SCFA in the cecal vein with those in other samples and gene expression associated with SCFA transporters and the tight junction are shown in Table 3 . While acetate and propionate concentrations in the cecal vein positively correlated with those in cecal digesta (p < 0.05), n-butyrate concentration in the cecal vein did not. Moreover, while the concentration of acetate in the cecal vein also positively correlated with that in the portal vein (p < 0.05), the concentrations of propionate and n-butyrate did not. Finally, the concentrations of SCFA in the cecal and the abdominal veins did not correlate. Interestingly, all SCFA concentrations in the cecal vein significantly correlated with the gene expression of MCT1 and occludin (p < 0.05). However, while the correlation with MCT1 gene expression was positive, the correlation with occludin gene expression was negative.\n\n SCFA are produced mainly in the hindgut of non-ruminant mammals [22] . In pigs, the cecum contains larger concentrations of SCFA in comparison with those found in the colon and rectum [6, 22] . Therefore, in the present work cecum was chosen as the organ to evaluate SCFA production.\n\n SCFA were readily detected in the cecal digesta of piglets, and their concentrations were detected to increase in suckling piglets from day 7 to day 28 after birth, but significant difference was not detected in acetate and n-butyrate (Figure 1a-c) . Regarding the acetate, however, significant difference was observed between S14 and S21 when statistical analysis was performed on the values for only suckling piglets. Due to piglets ingested only maternal milk during suckling, the increase in SCFA concentrations in the cecal digesta may have been caused mainly by changes in milk composition and consequently in microbiota composition. For example, Noblet & Etienne [23] reported that the lactose concentration in milk gradually increases after parturition.

We need rather to integrate all the available data from multiple sources. For example, a hypotensive patient with a low cardiac output will present diff erent diagnoses (hypovolemia, decreased contractility or obstruction) and hence require diff erent treatments to a hypotensive patient with a high cardiac output (decreased vascular tone). Likewise, as discussed earlier, correct interpretation of a low cardiac output involves consideration of many factors (Figure 2) , including some assessment of cardiac fi lling (pressures or dimensions) to assess ventricular preload.\n\n SvO 2 refl ects the balance between oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) and DO 2 and thus provides an indication of the adequacy of tissue oxygenation. If there is no PAC in situ, the oxygen saturation in the superior vena cava (ScvO 2 ) can be measured using a central venous catheter and has been proposed as a surrogate for SvO 2 . Importantly, ScvO 2 represents just an approximation of the SvO 2 [13] and the absolute values of ScvO 2 and SvO 2 are not interchangeable. Th e diff erence between these two parameters is infl uenced by the sampling site of central venous blood, the presence of left-to-right shunts, incomplete mixing of venous blood, oxygen extraction in the renal and the splanchnic beds, redistribution of blood fl ow through the upper and lower body, level of conscious ness (anesthesia) and myocardial VO 2 . Th e reliability of ScvO 2 is also dependent on the position of the tip of the catheter, with right atrial measurements closely approximating SvO 2 and high vena cava measurements often deviating substantially from SvO 2 . In general, SvO 2 is more useful when the value is below normal (see below), even though in these conditions it may not refl ect a hemodynamic problem. Simultaneous measurements of blood lactate levels can be helpful. A diagnostic algorithm based on SvO 2 and cardiac output is shown in Figure 3 .\n\n Although ICU physicians may like to increase cardiac output and SvO 2 by giving more fl uid and inotropic agents, is this always good? Excessive fl uid administration to increase cardiac output may result in fl uid overload with massive edema formation and this may be associated with worse outcomes [14] ; some systems measure extravascular lung water, which can help document this. Similarly, excessive doses of dobutamine can be detrimental, compromising myocardial function, especially in patients with coronary artery disease; giving inotropic agents in the presence of coronary artery disease is like trying to stimulate a tired horse. Using vasoactive agents and fl uids to increase DO 2 to supranormal levels in all patients may result in excessive mortality rates and this strategy has been abandoned [15] . A high ScvO 2 has been suggested as a target for some high risk patients or in shock resuscitation, with Rivers and colleagues [16] reporting that septic patients assigned to an early goaldirected therapy algorithm had higher ScvO 2 values and reduced mortality rates. However, this was a strategy for early resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis in a single institution, and needs further validation in multicenter studies, several of which are currently ongoing. Importantly, applying the same strategy in general ICU patients may not improve outcomes [17] . Indeed, in patients with sepsis, a high SvO 2 may be the result of maldistribution of peripheral blood fl ow and altered oxygen extraction, rather than adequate perfusion, such that patients may still deteriorate even with a high SvO 2 .\n\n In sepsis, a high cardiac output, like a high SvO 2 , can be associated with worse outcomes. \n\n Monitoring of acute changes in cardiac output can be important, for example, in patients at risk of acute bleeding or in assessing the response to fl uid administration to separate fl uid responders from non-responders.\n\n Evaluating the response to a dobutamine or to a nitrate infusion is another example of this functional monitoring that may also have sound clinical applications. Th is assessment of hemodynamic variations observed during the challenge of the cardiovascular system has been termed 'functional hemodynamic monitoring' [18] .
