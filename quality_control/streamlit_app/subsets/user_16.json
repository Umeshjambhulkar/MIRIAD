It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases.

Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Patients with late-stage pulmonary fibrosis (PF) mostly die of respiratory failure, the accompanying cardiac disease or lung infections [1] .\n\n In the last decade, major accomplishments have been achieved in decoding, diagnosing and treating PF as many new drugs and clinical guidelines have been advanced and utilized in PF patients. Clinical trials have tested a number of single or combination drug therapies to overwriting new clinical guidelines, but unfortunately the mortality of PF is still rising regardless of these advances [2] . There is general agreement that clinical trials should no longer be preventing further disease progression, but rather stabilizing lung function and exercise capacity [3] .\n\n Stem cell therapy has shed some new light on the management of PF as expert agreements have been achieved to favor stem cell therapy in chronic airway diseases and PF. The therapeutic role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been implicated in serial processes of lung injuryrepair disequilibrium and abnormal remolding in experimental lung fibrosis. Clinical trials have been launched to investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of MSCs in PF patients [4] .\n\n Bleomycin is the most widely used drug for chemical induction of PF in animal models. It is highly reproducible and produces fibrotic histologic picture similar to the human disease. Bleomycin instillation in rat lungs causes PF through an inflammatory process characterized by patchy parenchymal inflammation of variable intensity, epithelial cell injury with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, basement membrane damage, and interstitial as well as intra-alveolar fibrosis contributing the pathologic landmarks in both human PF and this model [5] .\n\n Some studies demonstrated the ability of adult tissue derived stem cells to differentiate into lung epithelial cells and confer a functional benefit [6] . This contribution of adult stem cells to the regeneration of lung tissue could be used as an alternative approach to the treatment of certain lung diseases. However, other studies failed to prove that adult stem cells could restore lung epithelium [7] .\n\n Concerning MSCs, Ortiz et al. [8] found that administration of these cells immediately after exposure to bleomycin rat significantly reduced the degree of bleomycin-induced inflammation and collagen deposition within lung tissue. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that murine MSCs home to the lung in response to injury, adopt an epithelium-like phenotype, and reduce inflammation and collagen deposition in lung tissue of mice challenged with bleomycin.\n\n To the best of our knowledge, no previous study of stem cell therapy of induced PF has tested CD34 + stem cells. Given the regenerative capacity of CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in hematological diseases, we decided to assess the reparative effect of this type of stem cells in murine model of induced PF structurally and functionally, and compare their results with those of MSCs.\n\n \n\n A total of 32 adult female albino local strain rats, weighting 250-300 gm each, were used in this study. Animals were purchased from the National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt. Animals were housed in polyethylene cages at room temperature (under controlled environmental conditions) and kept with free access to standard rodent chow diet and tap water ad libtium. Animals were allowed to acclimatize for one week before the start of the study. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.\n\n Rats were equally divided into four groups (8 rats each), group I (GI): the control untreated group included normal rats which did not receive any medications or stem cells, group II (GII) lung fibrosis group, group III (GIII) CD34 + stem cells treated group and group IV (GIV) MSCs treated group.

Despite differing in the type of neurologic lesion (lower vs. upper motor neuron), both conditions lead to similar muscle contractures, which dramatically reduce joint range of motion and limit the functional use of limbs for ambulating, reaching, and other activities of daily living. Furthermore, the muscular contractures alter the physical forces on the developing skeleton, leading to progressive dysplasia and dislocation of joints (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . These contractures are the primary driver of the need for rehabilitative and surgical therapies, assistive devices, and accommodations for daily functioning (10, 11) . However, no existing treatment strategies alter the actual contracture pathology, and instead can worsen function by further weakening already abnormal muscles (12) (13) (14) (15) . As a result, the contractures and their secondary skeletal consequences remain unchecked, leading to pain, loss of physical function, and heavy reliance on costly health care and supportive services. It is therefore imperative to gain a better understanding of contracture pathogenesis to develop novel strategies to prevent contractures.\n\n We developed a mouse model of NBPI that causes contractures precisely mimicking the human phenotype in both NBPI and CP (16) . With this model, we have made several important discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of contractures. First, it was unknown whether the tissue responsible for the clinical contracture phenotype was the muscle or the joint capsule, pathology of which commonly causes other forms of contractures (17) . We found that the elbow flexion contractures in our NBPI model could be completely Muscle contractures are a prominent and disabling feature of many neuromuscular disorders, including the 2 most common forms of childhood neurologic dysfunction: neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) and cerebral palsy. There are currently no treatment strategies to directly alter the contracture pathology, as the pathogenesis of these contractures is unknown. We previously showed in a mouse model of NBPI that contractures result from impaired longitudinal muscle growth. Current presumed explanations for growth impairment in contractures focus on the dysregulation of muscle stem cells, which differentiate and fuse to existing myofibers during growth, as this process has classically been thought to control muscle growth during the neonatal period. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model of NBPI that denervation does not prevent myonuclear accretion and that reduction in myonuclear number has no effect on functional muscle length or contracture development, providing definitive evidence that altered myonuclear accretion is not a driver of neuromuscular contractures. In contrast, we observed elevated levels of protein degradation in NBPI muscle, and we demonstrate that contractures can be pharmacologically prevented with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. These studies provide what we believe is the first strategy to prevent neuromuscular contractures by correcting the underlying deficit in longitudinal muscle growth.\n\n relieved by excision of the denervated elbow flexor muscles, leaving the joint capsule intact (16) . This finding highlights that NBPI-induced contractures are primarily due to tightness of denervated muscle, rather than pathology of other tissues such as bone, capsule, or ligaments. The next question was whether the tightness of the denervated muscle is a direct effect of denervation or a result of the muscle's altered mechanical environment. Neuromuscular contractures have previously been assumed to be the result of mechanical imbalance, whereby stronger muscles pull a joint into a contracted position due to weakness of antagonists (10) . We demonstrated that neonatal denervation of the elbow flexors causes elbow flexion contractures, but neonatal surgical excision of the triceps alone does not (18) . This finding rules out muscle strength imbalance as a cause of contractures, and instead highlights a direct effect of denervation on muscle tightness. Finally, it was unknown whether the tightness of denervated muscles resulted from fibrosis (muscle too stiff) or impaired longitudinal growth (muscle too short). Fibrosis, or increased extracellular matrix collagen accumulation, has been postulated to contribute to contractures in both NBPI and CP, owing to findings on muscle biopsies after contractures have formed (19, 20) . However, when we used our model to interrogate the role of fibrosis during contracture development, we found that fibrosis is not a causative mechanism (21) .", "qa": [["11_204958307_0_1", "What are the primary drivers of the need for rehabilitative and surgical therapies, assistive devices, and accommodations for daily functioning in neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) and cerebral palsy (CP)?\n", "The primary drivers of the need for rehabilitative and surgical therapies, assistive devices, and accommodations for daily functioning in NBPI and CP are muscle contractures.

One fifth of patients admitted to ICU in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and many more where such admission is as a medical emergency. 12 Many do so on the ICU itself. By 2004, one in five Americans who died already did so on, or shortly after admission to, an ICU 13 and this rate is increasing over time. But alarmingly, many ICU survivors face profound physical debility: aggressive and rapid muscle wasting is common in the critically ill, with some patients losing nearly 30% of their lower limb muscle in the first week. 14 Such impacts contribute to the significant limitations in functional capacity which affect 70% of critical illness survivors-debility which can last 8 years or more. 15 Overall, 30% are still dependent on the support of family and professional carers at 12 months. 16 Even a year after UK ICU discharge, income was reduced for the families of 28% and the number of patients for whom employment was the sole source of income had halved 17 . One-third of patients of working age will never work again. 16 One in five needed care assistance, generally from family members-whose employment was itself impacted in more than half. Three quarters suffered moderate or severe pain. 17 It is not only physical function which is degraded after critical care. A 'dementia-like' cognitive impairment may affect the majority after ICU discharge, and may be longstanding (45% are affected 2 years later) 18 or even permanent. Depression is also a common consequence of ICU admission, affecting up to 61% in the first 5 years. 19 In the UK, 44% remained significantly anxious or depressed a year after ICU discharge. 17 More than 25% suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after ICU care. 20 These impacts can affect the 'previously well'. But ICUs increasingly admit those with multiple chronic comorbidities, pre-existing poor functional capacity and limited life expectancy. It has thus been argued that disproportionate or inappropriate Intensive Therapy is commonly practiced in developed nations, 21 with serious negative impacts on patients, their carers (professional or otherwise) and on society. 17 Many might feel that it is time to change.\n\n Intensive Care Units have drifted towards becoming Intensive Therapy Units. For many, this has been a good thing: survival after major surgery, for example, can be enhanced by such care. In other cases, however compassion may be compressed by a demand for technical interventions, and the increasing ability to deliver them (so called \"provider bias\" or \"supply sensitive care\"). Practice of such 'disproportionate care' may in some cases verge on the unethical when practiced by those whose professional ethic guides to 'first do no harm' to the individual patient, or to others considering broader societal issues when state healthcare budgets are constrained 21 . What, then, to do?\n\n Humanising the ICU experience should be the highest priority for intensive care professionals. The suffering we inflict must be minimised. Diurnal rhythm and sleep, and pleasant site and smell, should be maximised. Pain, the administration of disorientating drugs, and noise, should be minimised.

Under euglycemic clamp conditions, the plasma half-life of insulin was 3.3 hours for U-100R and 4.4 hours for U-500R. The delayed action appeared to be the result of attenuated absorption from the subcutaneous depot and/or reduced clearance. Total glucose exposure (defined by total glucose infusion rate [GIR]) was not different between U-100R and U-500R, but PD parameters reflecting the duration of action were prolonged with U-500R. This supports the use of U-500R without concurrent basal insulin. Time to onset reinforces the dosing of U-500R 30 minutes prior to mealtime.\n\n Insulin degludec is able to form multihexamer chains following the subcutaneous injection. A soluble dihexamer is formed when phenol and zinc are present; however, after injection, phenol disperses and degludec forms multihexamer chains. As zinc is depleted, the individual hexamers disassociate into monomers, at which point degludec is able to be absorbed into the blood. 12 A fatty acid side chain buffers the molecules with albumin so that the plasma levels are very high using the current insulin immunoassays and are impossible to interpret. Although PK/PD parameters can be evaluated for degludec in glucose clamp studies, the actual plasma levels of degludec cannot be compared with other insulin analogs. Insulin degludec provides basal coverage and has been studied at both U100 and U200 concentrations. Degludec U100 was found to be bioequivalent to degludec U200 in individuals with T1DM. 13 Mean degludec, 24-hour concentration-time profiles and GIR at steady state, total insulin area under the curve (AUC), and C max were similar between degludec U100 and degludec U200. The glucose-lowering effects of degludec U100 and U200 were evenly distributed over 24 hours after dosing. The median time to maximum degludec U100 and U200 action was 9 hours, steady state was achieved after 48-72 hours of once-daily dosing, and degludec U200 was detectable for at least 120 hours after last dosing.\n\n In the context of the bioequivalence data, the terminal half-life of degludec U100 was twice when compared with glargine U100 (25.4 hours vs 12.5 hours, respectively).\n\n 14 Total exposure to degludec increased proportionately with increasing dose and was evenly distributed through 24 hours post administration. This is in contrast to glargine exposure, in which 60% of exposure occurred within the first 12 hours of dosing. Day-to-day glucose variability and within-subject variability have been reported to be lower with degludec U100 than glargine. 15 PK parameters of degludec U100 studied on individuals with T2DM, not on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), were similar to those seen in the abovementioned study 14 on individuals with T1DM. 16 In a larger analysis of five Phase I studies with individuals of various ages (including elderly populations) and ethnic backgrounds (including African American and Hispanic) with T1DM or T2DM, steady state was similarly observed at 2-3 days with low variability and \n\n Lamos et al was independent of the degludec U100 dose. 17 The glucoselowering effect of degludec U100 was not statistically affected by injection site (thigh, upper arm, or abdominal wall), although slightly reduced in the thigh. 18 Dose adjustment of insulin degludec U100 in renal impairment (down to an estimated glomerular filtration rate ,30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ), hemodialysis, or liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh grade A-C) is not required. 19, 20 Exposure and clearance of degludec U100 were similar to individuals with normal renal and hepatic function, although intensification of glucose monitoring and individualized dosing for those with renal or hepatic impairment is recommended.\n\n Insulin glargine U300 delivers insulin glargine at a higher concentration from the subcutaneous depot than insulin glargine U100. After subcutaneous injection, the acidic solution is neutralized which leads to the formation of a precipitate within the depot from which glargine U300 is slowly released.

When its activity is blocked, and hence cAMP production increases, medulloblastoma growth is inhibited, an effect similar to phosphodiesterase blockade [18] . During development, PKA opposes the effects of Hedgehog proteins and effectors, therefore PKA can be a reasonable target for MB with a high Hedgehog activity. PKA activity is essential to prevent the expression of Hedgehog effectors, for example Gli, albeit no mutation was up to now detected in PKA genes R1A, R1B, R2B, CA and CB [19] . This may be due to the lethal effects of PKA mutations, given their widespread presence in every cell.

This observation suggests that MB present a cAMP-binding protein that is different, or differentially organised, from that already known. The present data may be useful for implementing differential diagnosis tools or to design potential therapeutic agents.\n\n A further complication is added by the fact that each MB contains functionally heterogeneous cells, with a small fraction of them exhibiting stem-like properties [20] : the possibility exists that these cells show different signalling pathways dynamics, and hence can be targeted in a differential way.\n\n Up to now it was postulated that cAMP formation results in PKA activation: however, the formation of cAMP-saturated PKA holoenzymes, which are inactive, has been reported under physiological conditions [21] .

The patient was able to return to work a few days later and has continued to do well.\n\n To our knowledge this is the first report of pulmonary oedema occurring in a patient with IHSS secondary to ESWL treatment. Hypertrophic subaortic stenosis is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy with asymmetric septal hypertrophy and a dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction. 2 The pathophysiology of this autosomaldominant inherited condition 3 can be considered as a pressure gradient across the ventricular outflow tract. Three basic mechanisms are involved in the production of outflow obstruction and an increase in gradient, (1) increased left ventricular contractility, (2) decreased afterload, and (3) decreased preload which reduces ventricular volume. Many patients have histories of arrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. These arrythmias may lead to sudden death. Major symptoms of IHSS include angina, syncope, and congestive heart failure, a The ventricular hypertrophy make these patients susceptible to myocardial ischaemia. Patients with IHSS are often treated with 13-adrenergic blockers or calcium channel blockers to decrease heart rate and ensure longer ventricular filling time. The negative inotropic effects of these drugs decrease hypercontractility and may lessen the outflow gradient. In addition, disopyramide or amiodarone may be used as antiarrythmics.\n\n There have been several reports of pulmonary oedema in patients with IHSS that have been associated with the use of calcium channel blockers. 5-7 However these episodes occurred shortly after verapamil had been started. 4,5 Our patient had been taking verapamil for years without ill effect.\n\n Immersion of patients during ESWL has haemodynamic, pulmonary and other effects. The patient is placed in a head up position which can be associated with peripheral pooling of blood and diminished venous return to the heart. These changes can be lessened with immersion. 8 The effects of immersion have been studied in awake volunteers, 9-H but there have been few studies of the haemodynamic consequences of immersion in semisupine anaesthetized patients. Transaesophogeal Doppler studies have shown a reduction in cardiac output and increases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with immersion for ESWL. ~2 Werner et al. have shown an increase in central venous, and PCWP with immersion and a decrease towards normal values with emersion. 13 While there has been concern about haemodynamic changes with immersion little has been written concerning the effects of emersion. Lehman et al. reported a death occurring in a 70-yr-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and two previous myocardial infarctions. When the patient was removed from the tank he suffered a cardiac arrest. They suggested that due to acute reduction of preload during emersion the patient suffered a decrease in cardiac output and reinfarcted. 14 We hypothesize that the sudden occurrence of pulmonary oedema in the case reported here was also secondary to the sudden decrease in preload resulting from the rapid emersion of the patient from the ESWL tank. The decrease in preload reduces the size of the outflow tract, producing a transient dynamic obstruction. This acute episode of left sided heart dysfunction led to pulmonary oedema. The acute nature was demonstrated by the sudden increase in inspiratory pressure and decrease in 02 saturation. Unfortunately approximately 40 rain passed from the time of emersion until the first PCWP and cardiac output measurements were obtained. The PCWP may have been much higher at emersion and considerable reequilibration may have occurred before the first measurements were obtained.\n\n Two reports describe adverse occurrences in IHSS patients receiving spinal anaesthesia including myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. ~,J6 It was postulated that the increased venous capacitance and decreased preload resulting from the effects of spinal anaesthesia on the sympathetic nervous system exacerbated the outflow obstruction. These observations parallel our own.\n\n Treatment of pulmonary oedema in a patient with IHSS must be based on an understanding of the mechanism of cause. Diuretics, digoxin, nitrates or inotropes could all worsen the oedema by provoking further outflow obstruction. A fluid bolus would increase the preload and could help resolve the oedema. It is possible that iI the patient was placed back in the tank, allowed to reequilibrate and the water slowly allowed to drain then, the rapid decrease in preload could have been blunted. We used an esmolol infusion to reduce her heart rate, reduce myocardial contractility and allow a prolonged diastolic fdling time to reduce the outflow tract obstruction.\n\n In conclusion, we describe a patient with IHSS who developed pulmonary oedema upon emersion from an ESWL tank. Pulmonary oedema was caused by a combination of the patient's unusual pathophysiology and rapid haemodynamic changes induced by emersion.

It is reported that extracellular ATP regulates platelet reactivity by way of direct action on platelet purinergic receptors or by hydrolysis to ADP [33, 34] .

TXA 2 formation was monitored by TXB 2 formation in this study. TXB 2 release was inhibited by PM21 significantly in this study. Released serotonin enhances platelet aggregation [6, 35] . In our study, serotonin release was inhibited significantly by PM21. Released granule contents from activated platelets lead to a series of downstream events that finally cause to elevate intracellular concentration of calcium ion [9] . In this study, collagen treatment dramatically escalated intracellular calcium concentration and PM21 lowered it in a dose-dependent manner. From the results of serotonin, TXA 2 and intracellular calcium concentration assays, PM21 shows inhibition potency on the release of granule contents and on the influx of calcium ions from extracellular fluid and mobilization from intracellular pools.\n\n The phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as ERKs is an important step for both outside-in and inside-out signaling that is closely associated with platelet activation and aggregation [36, 37] .

PLC\u03b32 subsequently induces the formation of second messengers DAG (1,2-diacylglycerol) and IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate).

In recent years, many cancer centers have adopted the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) (primary chemotherapy followed by RT or concurrent chemoradiotherapy) for localized disease to reduce the relapse rate [3] [4] [5] . Due to overexpression of multi-drug resistance (MDR) gene in NKTCL cells [6] , anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens are no longer the standard of care for NKTCL, and with increasing evidence asparaginase-based regimens are now frontline treatments [5, [7] [8] [9] .\n\n Circulating cell-free EBV DNA can be detected in plasma from patients with EBV-associated neoplasm [10] [11] [12] .

Thus, in the era of asparaginase, whether plasma EBV-DNA levels can still retain their prognostic value or not remains to be investigated. Kwong et al.

The prognosis is particularly poor in neonates with mortality rates of 20-40% and long-term neurologic sequelae in up to 50% of survivors (1, 2) . Therefore, the development of new adjuvant therapies that can modulate neuronal injury during bacterial meningitis will be necessary to improve the outcome of this disease.\n\n Neuronal damage from bacterial meningitis is a multifactorial process. Besides the acute inflammatory responses in the subarachnoid space (3) (4) (5) (6) , alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) may have an additional and even critical role in the pathogenesis of brain injury that can result in neurologic sequelae or death during bacterial meningitis (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), calculated as the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP), has been known to be the main factor influencing CBF in bacterial meningitis (9, 11) . With intracranial hypertension and systemic hypotension observed in bacterial meningitis, CPP can be reduced to a certain threshold level that can no longer sustain CBF sufficient for metabolic demand, and hence, cerebral ischemia may ensue (12) . An association between cerebral ischemia and poor neurological outcome or death has been demonstrated in various studies of bacterial meningitis (13) (14) (15) .\n\n Although CPP less than 30 mmHg was strongly correlated with death or major neurological sequelae in infants and children with intracranial infections (11, 16) , the degree of ICP elevation alone was not a negative prognostic factor if it was associated with a corresponding elevation in systemic MAP to maintain adequate CPP (11) . In a rabbit model of pneumococcal meningitis, although ICP elevation occurred during the early stages of infection, CPP was maintained adequate for cerebral metabolic need if MAP remained normal, and cerebral ischemia and death of experimental animals were observed only with hemodynamic collapse and resultant critical reduction of CPP (12) , and maintenance of MAP by high fluid therapy prevented cerebral ischemia (17) . In patients with Hemophilus influenzae meningitis, shock at the time of admission was associated with poor outcome (18) . In traumatic brain injury patients, management of CPP by maintaining optimal MAP and ICP yielded lower mortality and better clinical outcome than that achieved with traditional management solely\n\n In the present study, we tested whether maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) by pharmacologically preventing systemic hypotension with dopamine infusion would prevent cerebral ischemia and attenuate energy depletion and neuronal injury even though intracranial pressure remains elevated in a newborn piglet meningitis model. Cerebral blood flow, measured at the end of the experiment using fluorescent microspheres, was significantly increased by dopamine infusion. The decreased cerebral cortical cell membrane Na + , K + -ATPase activity and increased lipid peroxidation products, indicative of meningitis-induced brain damage, were significantly attenuated by dopamine infusion. Dopamine also significantly attenuated the meningitis-induced reduction in both brain ATP and phosphocreatine levels and the increase in brain lactate level. In summary, maintenance of adequate CPP with dopamine prevented cerebral ischemia, reduced cerebral energy depletion, and attenuated brain injury in neonatal bacterial meningitis.\n\n based on ICP (19, 20) , and the avoidance of systemic hypotension was primarily responsible for this improved outcome (21, 22) . Taken together, these findings suggest that maintenance of adequate CPP, primarily by manipulating MAP, would prevent cerebral ischemia, attenuate the brain damage and improve the prognosis even though ICP remains elevated in bacterial meningitis.\n\n This study was done to determine whether maintenance of adequate CPP by pharmacologically preventing systemic hypotension with dopamine infusion would prevent cerebral ischemia and attenuate energy depletion and neuronal injury even though ICP remains elevated in neonatal bacterial meningitis. We used the newborn piglet as an animal model of neonatal bacterial meningitis because the piglet brain is comparable in vascular anatomy, energy metabolism, and maturity to human brain at birth (23) . Escherichia coli was used to induce meningitis because it is the most common Gram-negative pathogen of neonatal meningitis (2) . Adequate CPP was maintained by dopamine infusion because it is the drug of choice in the treatment of neonatal hypotension (24) .

Surgeons may rely on the navigation, perform minimal or not enough bone resections, and prolong operating room times even further in combination with a TKA that is performed less frequently.\n\n Improvements in coronal alignment (with fewer outliers) unfortunately have not produced improved clinical knee scores, implant survival, better TKA function, or durability, and this may be attributed to three potential causes: (1) the better alignment in two planes is mitigated by the remaining errors in the axial (rotational) plane either because of an incorrect definition of the Cartesian coordinate system through which the navigation system is referencing or by the shear malalignment of the components in the axial plane; (2) alignment goals of a neutral mechanical axis are not the correct goal, and individual adjustments need to be made based on each patient's anatomic variability; and (3) the groups studied are too small (insufficient power) and/or the clinical scoring systems measuring functional status are not refined enough and suffer early ceiling effects, not allowing to prove superiority. These three causes are not sufficient to conclude that surgical navigation has to be abandoned; on the contrary, the better accuracy in the coronal and sagittal planes is needed if we want to refine alignment goals.\n\n Although navigated TKA in its current form is arguably the best objective tool to measure our accuracy of component alignment in the operating room, orthopaedic surgeons lack the individual or collective surgical/anatomical targets to improve on the short-term functional scores at the present time. The majority of the studies reported in this review support this view. One of the main questions for knee arthroplasty surgeons that remains to be answered is how to create, modify, and identify knee (or other) functional assessment tools, imaging techniques, and reliable component alignment parameters to determine the benefits of navigated TKA. We are confident that the technology may improve component positioning and reduce imaging outliers; this is encouraging. Currently, however, it may be the case that we just do not have the appropriate tools (yet) to realize the true advantages of navigated TKA. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the few recent midterm reports of functional improvements with navigated TKA, yet remain discouraged by the study design flaws in this research.\n\n Factors other than limb alignment may affect the longterm durability of TKA [45, 53, 60, 118] . The dynamic loading of the knee [109] is multifactorial and thus the traditional 0\u00b0to 3\u00b0for mechanical axis alignment may not predict long-term TKA implant survival. The goal of achieving neutral mechanical axis in all patients has recently been brought into question. A recent study by Bellemans et al. [13] reported that over 30% of normal males had ''constitutional varus'' of the knee and returning such individuals to neutral alignment would change their native alignment, ligament balance, and potentially compromise the clinical result.\n\n The use of navigation in TKA requires extra training and results in additional operating room time and costs, which are a factor in implementing this technology. Combining navigated TKA [20, 21] with the already questionable and poor results [4] of minimally invasive TKA with an experienced surgeon may be considered; however, added time, increased costs, more complications, and no proven clinical advantages have been reported, and we disfavor this combination of technology and surgical techniques.\n\n If routine use of navigated TKA led to consistently improved patient care, it would be expected that the studies should show improvements in the same parameters. A reduction in outliers of mechanical axis malalignment may be achieved with navigated TKA; however, the costs, additional operating time, increased training, potential for new and increased complications, and the lack of reproducible evidence in favor of navigated TKA question its role in routine TKA. The established roles for navigated TKA include use in patients with extraarticular deformity or retained implants and hardware that does not allow for traditional extra-or intramedullary alignment guides. In addition, use in resident teaching to provide immediate feedback regarding the accuracy of cutting guide placement may be helpful. To effectively evaluate the medium-and longer-term results of navigated TKA, future clinical trials should be designed to follow patients at short and medium term to document improved clinical function and longer term to establish whether lower revision rates are achieved.", "qa": [["42_10239962_7_1", "What are the potential causes for the lack of improved clinical knee scores and TKA function despite improvements in coronal alignment with navigated TKA?\n", "The potential causes for the lack of improved clinical knee scores and TKA function despite improvements in coronal alignment with navigated TKA include errors in the axial (rotational) plane, incorrect definition of the Cartesian coordinate system used by the navigation system, shear malalignment of the components in the axial plane, alignment goals of a neutral mechanical axis not being the correct goal, and insufficient power or refinement in the clinical scoring systems used to measure functional status."], ["42_10239962_7_2", "What are the challenges faced by knee arthroplasty surgeons in determining the benefits of navigated TKA?\n", "Knee arthroplasty surgeons face challenges in determining the benefits of navigated TKA due to the lack of individual or collective surgical/anatomical targets to improve short-term functional scores.

Knowledge of the human microbiota has been accu mulating rapidly in recent years. The gut bacteria was previously regarded as passive or harmful waste, but the intestinal microbiota is currently respected as a wellorchestrated organism with an active role in the development of immunity and maintenance of health [14] . Microbial imbalance, dysbiosis, is suggested to play a role in many different diseases. The microbiota holds many expectations as a new treatment target. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a straight forward way to change the microbial composition of the intestine [14] . FMT has been shown to induce profound and longlasting changes in the microbiota, offering a means to modify the gut microbiota relatively per manently for the treatment of microbiotaassociated diseases [5] . FMT has become a widely accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) [69] . We, among others, have shown that FMT through colonoscopy is an effective treatment for rCDI [5] .\n\n Experience in many centres has shown that FMT is also safe when performed to a high standard [1013] . The risk of adverse events of FMT is low in well performed studies [6] . Rigorous screening of the donor is mandatory. Without proper screening, there is a possibility of transmitting infectious diseases and a possibility of transmitting conditions that FMT is suspected to ameliorate, such as obesity [14] . All FMT should be performed at a health care unit by professionals who are familiar with the procedure [15] . FMT is currently indicated only for rCDI [15] . If FMT is used for other indications, then patients should be carefully evaluated, and the results, whether positive or negative, should be reported. Our group has treated a few patients with conditions other than rCDI and outside of ongoing study programmes. Such cases have been evaluated carefully on an individual basis by a gastroenterologist, an infectious disease specialist and a microbiologist.\n\n Although FMT has been effective and generally safe in published studies, data concerning FMT in certain special groups are scarce [16] . More information is needed regarding the safety of FMT in immuno suppressed and other special groups such as patients undergoing haemodialysis [12] . In our FMTtreated patients, we gathered information on patients with significant comorbidities, such as immunedeficient patients, patients with an organ transplant and hae modialysis patients.\n\n \n\n Of the patients treated with FMT in Helsinki University Hospital, we searched for those treated for rCDI and having major comorbidities and those treated for indications other than rCDI. We included dialysis patients and patients with known immune deficiencies in the rCDI group; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), organ transplant or hematologic disease. We found 13 patients with rCDI and major comorbidities and 8 patients with conditions other than rCDI. We review the patient histories, the outcomes and adverse events of each patient.\n\n Since FMT policy and legislation differ from country to country [17, 18] , we consulted the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea), which is the national competent authority for regulating pharmaceuticals and blood and tissue products. Fimea noted that stool does not fall under the category of pharmaceuticals and did not consider it relevant to the establishment of new regulations specifically for FMT. In Finland, FMT studies do not require approval of the drug authority Fimea.\n\n In Finland, FMT may be used by doctors based on their own judgement. We recommend that clinicians using FMT follow international guidelines [15, 19] . FMT is indicated for rCDI treatment; for other indications, it should be used only in a clinical trial setting.\n\n Some of the patients described in this article have been treated with stool from a donor familiar to them. Most of the described patients have been treated with stool from a universal donor frozen and thawed stool from our local faecal bank. The faecal banking protocol is described in detail in our previous article [10] . Briefly, faecal material from a healthy donor is mixed with saline and glycerol and frozen at 80 \u2103. In some cases, we used the faecal suspension stored at 20 \u2103, which did not seem to affect the results or safety of FMT. The frozen suspension is thawed a few hours before FMT and collected into two 100mL syringes. When necessary, the suspension is passed through a presterilized, stainless steel tea strainer to remove larger particles.\n\n Donor screening was performed as described in detail by Mattila et al [6] and Satokari et al [10] .", "qa": [["65_43189366_0_1", "How has the perception of the intestinal microbiota changed in recent years and what role does it play in human health?", "In recent years, the intestinal microbiota has transitioned from being regarded as passive or harmful waste to being recognized as an active organism with a crucial role in the development of immunity and maintenance of health.
