It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

It is possible these dentists were more likely to have used conventional methods for a longer period and had not seen the need to change.\n\n Most CAD/CAM users had some form of training by companies or were self-taught but a significant percentage (33%) felt that this training was insufficient. This finding clearly highlights a gap in dental education and continuing professional development (CPD) courses. It may be time for universities to offer formal evidence-based teaching of CAD/CAM technology in CPD courses.\n\n A significant number of CAD/CAM users reported that the technology had affected their clinical decision-making and choice of materials, mainly increasing the use of lithium disilicate and zirconia. It was interesting to observe that the respondents related CAD/CAM use to more conservative tooth preparations and adhesive dentistry, whereas this technology is not a pre-requisite for such clinical approaches. This may be the result of company-led training. From a material point of view, zirconia can only be processed through CAD/CAM technology. However, its clinical use is not without technical problems and long-term survival data is lacking. 24, 25 One respondent mentioned the potential for over-use of a chairside CAD/CAM system and materials to make up for the expense of the equipment itself. This comment highlights the possibility that dentists may use materials they would not otherwise have chosen to use if CAD/CAM had not been available.\n\n Users of chairside CAD/CAM also commented on the time saved as there was no lab-turnaround time involved , and restorations could be fitted on the same day without the need for provisionalisation. This is in agreement with the literature 26, 27 showing that digital production methods may be more cost/time effective. Those who used CAD/CAM as part of their implant workflow felt that it allowed for accurate 3D planning and could possibly enable flapless implant placement. This aspect of CAD/CAM has been increasingly well documented and developed through the years. [28] [29] [30] An interesting finding of the survey was that the aesthetic quality was highlighted as the major shortcoming of CAD/CAM restorations. Although there are no recently published studies on this issue, 31 it is noteworthy that the industry has introduced polychromatic blocks of materials for CAD/CAM use during the last years, possibly in an attempt to improve aesthetics of monolithic restorations.\n\n The majority of respondents to the survey did not currently use CAD/CAM in their workflow. By far the most common reason for not using CAD/CAM was high initial costs, especially for GDPs. The second most common reason was the lack of perceived advantages over conventional fabrication routes, referred to more by dentists with further restorative postgraduate training and specialist prosthodontics. Indeed, with the exception of possible time and cost effectiveness, 26, 27 the current literature 11, [32] [33] [34] has shown that digital workflows can produce restorations which perform equally well compared to those fabricated through conventional workflows. However, more than half of non-users responded positively regarding the future incorporation of digital workflows, particularly younger dentists as would be expected. The various interesting comments made by respondents clearly highlighted initial costs as the major obstacle for the incorporation of digital workflows, particularly in NHS settings. Based on the potential time/cost benefits offered by technology, the NHS should consider a cost/benefit analysis in future planning. This obstacle was further highlighted by the fact that, although the vast majority of respondents (89%) felt that CAD/CAM had a big future in dentistry, dentists who undertook predominantly private work were significantly more likely to answer positive.\n\n Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions could be drawn:\n\n \u2022 Most of the respondents did not use CAD/CAM technology in their workflow.

However, there are also disadvantages to using CAD/CAM technology. One major disadvantage is the high initial costs associated with acquiring the equipment. Additionally, some dentists feel that the training for CAD/CAM use is insufficient, highlighting a gap in dental education and continuing professional development courses.

By incorporating CAD/CAM technology into dental education and CPD courses, dentists can receive comprehensive and standardized training that covers the technical aspects of using CAD/CAM systems, as well as the clinical decision-making and material selection considerations associated with this technology. This will ensure that dentists are well-prepared to incorporate CAD/CAM technology into their workflow and make informed choices regarding its use."]]}, {"passage_id": "14_13924916_2", "passage": "In particular, advice as to how best to impart information to family and friends will be given, which helps to alleviate some of the stress that the family inevitably feels that they are under.\n\n An indicator of karyotype, such as rapid FISH analysis, will usually be known by the time of the first meeting, and this together with the genital appearances will guide the subsequent assessment.\n\n The exclusion of any associated adrenal insufficiency is of paramount importance and will be made in almost every case in our centre. A urinary steroid profile ideally forms part of the routine assessment in many cases, as this will not only help with adrenal insufficiency, but will also provide diagnostic information after the third day of life in most forms of CAH, and from 2-3 months for 5a-reductase deficiency.\n\n Whether to stimulate potential testicular tissue with a 3-day or 3-week human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test can be a difficult decision, especially if a female sex of rearing is being considered. The effects of postnatal androgen exposure to the developing brain are unknown, especially if the baby is subsequently raised female. Measurements of anti-M\u00fc llerian hormone and inhibin B are proving increasingly useful for assessing gonadal (testicular) integrity, but these assays are not established in all centres and results are not always available quickly if assays are run intermittently or if samples are sent out to specialised centres for analysis.\n\n Genital photography will often be undertaken at the first meeting and again after any gonadal stimulation. However, detailed notes of the genital examination should be made by the urologist as photographs can be misleading (e.g., suprapubic fat pad) and corporal consistency on palpation is not always reflected well by images. Any potential dysmorphic or associated features should be noted and the experience of a clinical geneticist obtained early in such situations, as such signs can be subtle in the early newborn period.\n\n Imaging (e.g., pelvic ultrasound) has a role in locating gonads and possibly identifying M\u00fc llerian structures but should be viewed with extreme caution, especially if undertaken by an inexperienced radiologist. This can be misleading, even in experienced hands. The presence of M\u00fc llerian structures or descended gonads by themselves should not be the deciding factor in gender assignment, but parents often focus on this information, especially if the limitations of this analysis are not explained.\n\n The aims of the initial assessment and subsequent presentation at the MDT are to establish the appropriate sex of rearing, form a plan of diagnostic procedures and provide psychological support for each individual family as a whole. Several factors need to be considered when counselling the family about gender assignment, such as likely gender identity; urological and sexual function; the likely need for endocrine replacement; fertility options and long-term tumour risk. These factors can be influenced by the underlying diagnosis; therefore, attempts at achieving a specific diagnosis as soon as possible are important. However, it is also extremely important that every case is viewed individually, as the range of phenotypes can vary significantly even within patients with the same underlying diagnosis, and long-term outcome data for many forms of DSD are not readily available.\n\n Of course, it is of vital importance that parents are involved in the decision-making process and are fully aware of the potential implications for the child. To have to contemplate gender reassignment at a later stage is one of the most difficult areas and can take several lengthy consultations between family and professionals. Adopting an MDT approach can help facilitate parents' understanding of the issues, and provides continuity of care and consistency of information.

In prior studies of persons with undiagnosed COPD, airflow obstruction was most often mild, however, more severe disease was also found [17, 18] . Defining early or undiagnosed COPD can lead to higher smoking cessation rates [19] , but other benefits as increased survival are yet to be established, although some evidence shows treatment in early, mild COPD slows decline in lung function [20, 21] . The United States Preventive Services Taskforce recommends the use of spirometry to screen for COPD in symptomatic persons [22] . As COPD is a leading cause of death in the USA, one could argue the best approach would be an aggressive, comprehensive strategy to screen and diagnose disease. Studies as the RETHINC trial [23] are evaluating benefits of pharmacological treatment of early disease.\n\n There is increasing emphasis on targeting persons with early COPD, those at risk of developing disease including young adults, as well as persons with COPD but are undiagnosed [1, 2, 24] . Using the criteria of a minimum of 10 tobacco-years and at least one significant respiratory symptom, high-risk for COPD was evident as early as 25 years-old (2.5%), the rate then increased, and plateaued at 45 years-old. This pattern could reflect persons eventually being diagnosed in their 40 s and 50 s, their disease did not progress to COPD [25] or early mortality [26, 27] . Smoking, environmental exposures, and early life lung function are important determinants for lung function decline [25, 28, 29] . Smoking rates were highest in the 25-34 years-old, likely a contributor to the respiratory symptoms as productive cough in this age group and thus a self-report of a provider-diagnosis of COPD. Asthma early in life appears to be an important risk factor for developing COPD, especially in smokers [25, 28, 29] . We found that asthma was more common in the high-risk group than the low-risk group, and the greatest prevalence was in those with diagnosed COPD.\n\n Martinez et al. proposed that early changes leading to COPD should be studied in persons <50 years-old with \u226510 pack-years using objective measures as spirometry and radiography to define early disease, but not symptoms [24] . They did point out the risk of COPD is greater in symptomatic persons without airflow obstruction, however there was a dissociation between structural lung damage and symptoms. Although it is unknown what portion of subjects in our study who reported frequent respiratory symptoms had AO by spirometry or structural changes, the presence of symptoms are invariably important and are known to affect overall well-being and long-term outcomes [27, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , and may be a better predictor of mortality than forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) [27, 36, 38] . In the COPDGene study, symptomatic ever-smokers without airflow obstruction, regardless of history of asthma, had greater activity limitation, lower pulmonary function, and more airway-wall thickening by computed tomography than did asymptomatic ever-smokers [37] .\n\n Health impairments, respiratory symptoms, and comorbidities were common in persons at high-risk for COPD as has been reported persons with undiagnosed COPD (31) as well as in those with significant respiratory symptoms without airflow obstruction [37, 39] . In our study, where those at high-risk likely include undiagnosed persons, measures of physical impairment were evident by high rates of DOE and difficulty in walking or climbing stairs. Physical impediments contribute to deconditioning and worsened dyspnea [40] , whereas mental health issues as anxiety and depression contribute to increased respiratory symptoms [41] . Mental health effects were apparent in the high-risk group as shown by high rates of depression and frequent mental distress, similar to that reported by those with COPD.\n\n The effects of gender on COPD risk were found in this study as men were more likely to be at high-risk for COPD, and conversely women were more likely to be diagnosed with COPD. Although women are less likely to smoke and have shorter lifetime tobacco duration than men, they are more susceptible to the effects of tobacco [42] and use a greater portion of their lung capacity [43] .", "qa": [["22_58947647_3_1", "What are some risk factors for developing COPD?\n", "Risk factors for developing COPD include smoking, environmental exposures, early life lung function, and a history of asthma.

Bartsch et al. reported another new technique for PG, which combines one binding purse-string and two transfixing mattress sutures between the pancreatic stump and the posterior gastric wall. Although Bartsch et al. modified the techniques of Ohigashi from 4 to 6 mattress sutures to two transfixing mattress sutures, these techniques still require transpancreas sutures. Every suture carries the risk for pancreatic laceration resulting in pancreatic leakage, especially in a fragile and soft pancreatic remnant. 24 Peng et al. introduced four types of binding PG using binding purse-string without transpancreas sutures. Types I and II placed the suture in the mucosal layer through an opening in the gastric anterior wall or the sealed distal gastric stump. However, this technique was not comfortable for surgeons and prolonged the operation time. Types III and IV were designed to avoid opening the gastric anterior wall or the sealed distal gastric stump, and, instead, the binding anastomosis was performed behind the posterior stomach wall directly. However, it was also not an easy procedure nor was it safe to place the inner suture. 16 In this study, we reported a new anastomosis technique using two continuous hemstitch sutures without transpancreas sutures for pancreatogastrostomy for soft pancreas. Compared with other anastomosis techniques, our method has the following advantages: (1) it is simple and easy. First, only two continuous hemstitch sutures are placed in the mucosal and seromuscular layers of the posterior gastric wall. Second, the mucosal layer of the posterior gastric wall is not removed and has only a lateral stab incision. In addition, the inner continuous hemstitch suture is preset out of the gastric cavity and drawn in through the opening of the sealed distal gastric stump. It is comfortable and easy for surgeons to suture and bind the pancreas in this way. Third, we use the opening of the sealed distal gastric stump and avoid excising the gastric anterior wall. The median time to perform PJ using this technique was only 12 min (range, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . (2) It is safe. First, our modified technique can be carried out safely on the normal pancreas to avoid a PF because there is no suture through the pancreas. Second, a common reason for reoperation is upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Hemorrhage occurs most often at the site of the gastroenterostomy or PG. Bleeding following PG can occur from either the anastomotic site or the cut surface of the pancreas. The modified technique with continuous hemstitch sutures could effectively prevent hemorrhage in the cut edges of both the mucosal and seromuscular layers of the posterior gastric wall. Finally, the inner continuous hemstitch sutures are visibly tightened in the gastric cavity.\n\n In conclusion, the described pancreatogastrostomy modification with double-binding continuous hemstitch sutures in the posterior gastric wall is simple, safe, and reliable.

IV). In the Tuscan sample, meeting the PAGL was associated with less alcohol use (p = 0.04).\n\n In this analysis regular PA has been consistently associated with positive health indicators. To the contrary high SBM use was associated with worse physical health, quality of life, quality of family relationships and breakfast frequency. Even though the extent of some of these relationships was small, the fact that the results was constant considering various health behaviours and across different geographical areas lead to the conclusion that PA and SBM use may be considered as general indicators of physical, psychological and social health. The results provide a solid base for the promotion of PA and a reduction in the use of SBM in adolescents. The potential general positive effects regular PA as part of a healthy lifestyle includes amongst others a general sense of well-being, which in turn might promote a higher quality of psychological and social functioning [6, 10] . PA has proven to also have positive effects on mood [5] and cognitive functioning [46] , which lead to believe that also the personal and social spheres of life might benefit from PA. The negative indicators associated with SBM use may be related to the fact that the use of SBM promotes a more passive lifestyle. Moreover, TV viewing signifies that adolescents are not engaging in other activities such as social interactions, or focusing on personal or social issues. An active involvement with the environment rather than a passive observation thereof has been linked with a more developed sense of competency in youth [47] . The patterns of PA and SBM use have shown clear relationships with fruit consumption and breakfast frequency. These relationships were among the most significant in both samples considered. Children, who eat breakfast regularly, generally spend less than two hours a day in front of TV/PC. Breakfast omission in physically active children contrasts with their increased energy requirements and, in accordance with our study, often it is replaced by televisions programs [37] , this finding can be particularly worrying given the relationship between high energy intake and TV viewing in increasing overweight. Both in Tuscany and Italy there is a strong association between PA and fruit consumption, the results support a transfer effect where very active children are also more likely to eat more fruit. Although increased fruit intake is an important aspect of obesity prevention, it needs to be coupled with a decreased consumption of food with a high fat and high sugar content and increased PA. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms and moderators (e.g., gender) which influence the relationship between PA and nutrition behavior.\n\n In Italy the quality of peer relationships was positively related to PA. It has been clearly demonstrated that peer interactions are environments for PA and peer influences represent a motivating factor for PA [48] . The relationship was not significant considering SBM use, although peer interactions and use of the media are ubiquitous elements of adolescence, and it is possible that engagement with peers is a reflection of engagement in the adolescent culture [49] . When considering the negative health indicators, it emerged that time spent watching TV/PC was related to two of the three negative health indicators in an independent way in the Tuscan sample and a third (alcohol use) in the Italian sample. These results are consistent with previous studies [22] . Tobacco use is a clear exception, representing a protective factor for SBM use. This finding can be explained by arguing that higher SBM use means more time spent in front of the TV/PC, activities typically confined to a home environment where the possibility of smoking is limited. A more complex scenario emerged when observing PA and negative health indicators. In Tuscany, but not in Italy, PA was positively related to health status, children meeting PAGL registered less health complaints. The trend appears to be opposite, as shown in other studies, where PA and sport activities is associated with physical injuries [22] . No significant relation emerged when meeting PAGL and cigarette consumption was considered in different age and gender groups. This was true for both samples. Similar studies suggest that engaging in PA in adolescence is associated with lower rates of smoking during adolescence and adulthood [3, 28] . Adherence to PAGL, perceived health status and the quality of peer relationships were found to be better in Italian youth; Tuscan youth reported slightly more SBM use, regular breakfast consumption, fewer health complaints and a higher quality of family relationships. The overall pattern of the relationship between PA and SBM use with positive and negative health indicators was fairly consistent across the two samples considered.

FITNESSGRAM's criterion-referenced standards for BMI were developed from percent of body fat estimated from skinfold thickness, which was linked to the metabolic syndrome using a large sample of children and adolescents from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [11] . The BMI standards are currently used as part of a comprehensive fitness test battery in physical activity or physical education settings. Other researches have found WHtR cut-points ranging between 0.60 in obese Mexican adolescents [30] , 0.47 in young Brazilian children [31] , 0.465 in female and 0.455 in male South African children [32] , and 0.475 in female and 0.485 in male Chinese children [18] . The discordance in developed WHtR cut-points may be the result of the referent variable used for comparison (e.g., metabolic syndrome, percent of body fat, and BMI), genetics, diet, age, sex, and the procedures and instrumentation used to collect anthropometric and health measurements [33] . Despite this, the cut-points derived from various studies approximate the 0.5 cut-point found in this study, which is in exact accordance with the weighted mean boundary found from a recent metaanalysis [33] .\n\n In addition to its relative ease of interpretation, WHtR also has the benefit of capturing visceral adipose deposition, which has been shown to increase low-grade systemic inflammation in the body, a possible genesis for early incident cardiometabolic disease risk factors [34] . One limitation of WHtR is that some administered training may be needed to yield a reliable and valid waist circumference measurement, whereas, with BMI, no training is needed. However, WHtR in many studies has been shown to classify individuals of all ages with greater accuracy than BMI because of its ability to isolate central adiposity [35] . Height and bone structure confounding is partially controlled for when dividing the waist measurement by height; therefore its validity as a body composition index is robust regardless of stature.\n\n Although WHtR strongly agreed with BMI standards, its ability to distinguish children who did or did not meet individual cardiometabolic blood markers was classified as weak to fair. Most studies show an association between WHtR and individual and clustered cardiometabolic biomarkers [36] . WHtR has also been found to be associated with certain health behaviors in children such as TV viewing, sedentary behavior, and irregular breakfast [37] . In this study the accuracy in distinguishing children with unfavorable cardiometabolic biomarkers has been found to be similar compared to previous research [31, 32] . The relative lower accuracy of WHtR in children compared to older cohorts may be because of the greater difficulty to detect unfavorable risk factors because these traits may take several years to develop. Indeed, the prevalence for unfavorable biomarkers was less than 50% for most measures, except for HDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure, and quite low for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Another reason for the weak accuracy in WHtR classifying children may have been because of the use of a capillary blood sample to collect the biomarkers. Capillary blood sampling, although convenient, may overestimate certain biomarkers compared to venous blood sampling [38] . Future research should use venous blood sampling to possibly yield more valid results. This is the first study to establish a WHtR cut-point associating with FITNESSGRAM's criterion-references standards for BMI in low-income children. This is also the first study to associate WHtR with standards developed from FITNESS-GRAM. Practically, the results from this study yield certain implications. WHtR can be used as an alternative to BMI in field settings, specifically in physical education settings for body composition assessment. As stated previously, WHtR has the benefit of capturing central adipose deposits that pose more of a health threat compared to subcutaneous deposits on a child's body [30] . Screening for central adiposity at an early age may help attenuate the risk of developing visceral adipose deposits later in life and thus attenuate incidence of unfavorable cardiometabolic disease risk factors. Although the accuracy of distinguishing low-income children with unfavorable cardiometabolic disease risk was weak to fair, statistically significant agreement was still found; therefore there is still utility for WHtR's use as a cardiometabolic screening tool. However, future research needs to explore these associations further using larger sample sizes, venous blood sampling, and more ethnically diverse samples.\n\n There are limitations to this study that must be considered before generalizations can be made. First, the sample consisted of low-income children, primarily Hispanic, from schools located within the Mountain West region of the USA. Therefore, the external validity of the results is questionable if the results are to be generalized to higher socioeconomic status children or to samples comprising different ethnic representation. Second, a capillary blood sample was obtained to analyze the cardiometabolic blood markers, which may overestimate levels within 5% compared to venous blood samples. Third, the acquired sample size of 219 children is relatively low for cross-sectional descriptive studies employing ROC curves analysis; therefore future research should address the research question using larger sample sizes to improve statistical power and the internal validity of the results. Finally, diet was not accounted for in the analysis, which may influence cardiometabolic health markers. Future research should account for the potential confounding of diet when examining the relationship between WHtR and cardiometabolic health.\n\n In conclusion, the derived WHtR cut-point of 0.50 strongly agreed with FITNESSGRAM's criterion-referenced standards for BMI. The WHtR = 0.50 cut-point has also been indicated in prior research within the adolescent and adult populations and may provide a valid alternative to BMI as a body composition assessment metric in low-income children. Despite the strong agreement with BMI, its ability to distinguish low-income children who achieved individual blood marker recommendations was weak to fair. This may have been because of the low prevalence of certain risk factors or the use of capillary blood sampling. This study was the first to establish a WHtR cut-point that associated with criterionreferenced BMI using a sample of low-income children from the USA.

Rapid untwisting during isovolumetric relaxation is crucial in the development of low LV pressures (44) . Delayed or prolonged untwisting results in ineffective recoil, with little benefit to the transmitral pressure gradient (20, 44, 47) . Rapid myocardial untwisting in early diastole has been shown to contribute to the occurrence of diastolic suction, whereby minimum LV pressure may become relatively negative (or increasing chamber dimension despite declining pressures) (64) . A lower LV pressure (assuming a constant left atrial pressure) results in a greater transmitral filling gradient and a higher rate of flow (12, 34) . Therefore, any perturbation that could affect the rate of untwisting either acutely (e.g., reduced end-systolic volume) or chronically (e.g., endurance training) could significantly impact transmitral filling, end-diastolic volume (EDV), and ultimately stroke volume.\n\n Diastolic filling rates, transmitral pressures, and LV rotation during exercise. An elevated heart rate during exercise results in reduced diastolic filling time (23) . Consequently, diastolic function (and diastolic filling rate) must be augmented during exercise to attain the same LVEDV in a shorter amount of time. Endurance-trained athletes have larger increases in LVEDV and stroke volume compared with untrained individuals, and, therefore, they must have a more dramatic increase in diastolic filling and function during exercise (23, 70) . Doppler echocardiography has been used to show an increase in the early diastolic peak filling velocity with exercise and a greater increase in endurance athletes compared with normal individuals (13, 59) . These findings are all indicative of enhanced filling rates in endurance athletes during exercise. Numerous mechanisms could contribute to greater LV filling and EDV in endurance athletes including greater blood volumes (14, 68) , increased LV compliance (38) , reduced diastolic ventricular interactions (17) , as well as potentially greater increases in the transmitral pressure gradient and LV rotation with exercise.\n\n Increased early diastolic filling velocities during exercise suggest an increase in the transmitral pressure gradient. Numerous researchers have shown the transmitral pressure gradient (or the intraventricular pressure gradient measured from apex to base) to be increased during exercise (9, 44, 52) . In the animal model, Cheng et al. (9) demonstrated an increase in the transmitral pressure gradient as a result of a reduced minimal LV pressure without a significant change in left atrial pressure. Because of the reductions in minimal LV pressure, there was a downward shift in the diastolic portion of the pressure-volume relationship during exercise compared with rest. The net result was an increased LVEDV and stroke volume despite a shorter diastolic filling time (9) . Similar increases in the transmitral pressure gradient as a result of reductions in minimal LV pressure have been shown in humans during dobutamine infusion (65) .\n\n Recently, Notomi et al.

Interestingly, these authors demonstrated a sequential time course between peak diastolic untwisting rates, peak intraventricular pressure gradient (an indicator of diastolic suction) (42) , and peak early diastolic filling velocity (Fig. 3) . The sequential nature of their findings suggests the important contribution of each phase on the following step; that is, untwisting aids in generating the pressure gradient, and the pressure gradient is essential for peak diastolic filling velocity. Notomi and colleagues also reported that during exercise the greatest relative increase in proportional contribution to stroke volume is from LV circumferential motion. It should be noted that the participants in the study by Notomi et al. were exercising at a relatively low intensity (heart rate of \u03f3112 beats/min) for a short period of time. Others have also shown increases in torsion and recoil with low intensity acute exercise, or after exercise (41, 63) . Stuber et al.

Association with paternal HLA-DR2 has also been reported (10) . The improvement in PG symptoms before delivery and the relapse at the time of delivery have also led researchers to link the natural course of PG with progesterone, which has immunosuppressive properties, and with the increase in progesterone levels in late pregnancy, followed by a reduction during delivery (1). However, the exact patho genetic mechanism of PG remains largely unknown.\n\n In SC pregnancies, placental and foetal tissues have paternal antigens that are foreign to the maternal immune system (1). Thus, the semi-allogenic foetus escapes maternal immune rejection and induces tolerance, creating an immune-privileged site at the foetal-maternal interface (11) (12) (13) . Nevertheless, silencing of the maternal immune response against an entirely allogenic foetus involves more complex, and possibly different, mechanisms than in SC pregnancies with semi-allogenic foetuses (12) . Indeed, ED pregnancies are much more likely to bear a higher degree of HLA mismatches and antigenic dissimilarity between the pregnant women and their children, in comparison with SC pregnancies (Fig. S1   1 ) (11, 12) . It has been demonstrated that successful ED pregnancies are characterized by an increased number of activated (CD4 + CD25 dim ) and regulatory (CD4 + CD25 bright ) T lymphocytes, the latter being implicated in the regulation of the maternal peripheral immune system (13) . These findings are combined with a stronger down-regulation of the alloimmune response in the maternal blood of ED compared with SC pregnancies (13) . These protective mechanisms could maintain and reinforce the immunosuppressive environment in the pregnant uterus, in this way enabling the entirely allogenic foetus to survive. However, a greater risk for placental complications, in particular pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, has been reported in ED pregnancies (12, 14) and suggested to be related to immunological intolerance between the mother and the foetus.\n\n Concerning PG presenting during ED pregnancy, there is only one previous literature report in a primiparous woman (15) .

On right hemithorax puncture, air was drained. The patient did not respond to the maneuvers and died.\n\n The ASD is the most common congenital heart disease in adulthood. It is characterized by a communication between the atria, being classified into four types (ostium primum, ostium secundum, sinus venosus and defect involving the coronary sinus). Only the ostium secundum defects are true ASD. The other types originate from defects in other structures, causing a communication between the atrial cavities.\n\n The ostium secundum ASD is the most commonly found, corresponding to 80% of the cases, and results from the excessive resorption of the septum primum or deficient growth of the septum secundum. 1 It usually has an insidious clinical presentation. The communication between the atria causes left-to-right shunt since birth; however, most children are asymptomatic. The malformation is detected on physical examination because of the presence of a systolic heart murmur on the left sternal border. Thus, the symptoms usually begin in adolescents or young adults. At the fifth decade of life, 75% to 80% of the patients are symptomatic. 1 Our patient is a 56-year-old male diagnosed with ASD after the appearance of right heart failure symptoms. The diagnosis was late, when pulmonary hypertension secondary to that congenital malformation had already installed. At that stage, the patient already had reverse right-to-left shunt, and ASD correction was contraindicated. 1 Surgical correction is indicated in the presence of a significant ASD or associated right ventricular overload, even when symptomless. The correction should be carefully assessed, because, when performed at a late stage, they can cause serious complications. 2 When inadvertent, the ASD correction may worsen pulmonary hypertension, because the right-to-left shunt closure can increase pulmonary arterial pressure, aggravating the right heart failure. In addition, in more advanced cases, in which LV systolic dysfunction is associated, ASD closure increases pulmonary capillary pressure, causing pulmonary edema. 2 Some parameters, such as normal oxygen saturation at rest or exertion, left-to-right shunt on echocardiography, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure lower than 70 mmHg, should be assessed before indicating ASD correction. 2 None of these parameters were present in our patient.\n\n To our patient, who had a late diagnosis of ASD complicated with pulmonary hypertension, surgical correction was contraindicated. The unrepaired ASD resulted in reverse right-to-left shunt, progressing to Eisenmenger syndrome, the final stage of pulmonary obstructive vascular disease secondary to the preexisting left-to-right shunt. \n\n The Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with several complications: arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary and systemic thrombosis, hemoptysis, renal dysfunction, cerebral abscess, gout and biliary lithiasis. 3 At the time our patient was diagnosed, he already had right heart failure and RV dysfunction. As the disease progressed, episodes of pulmonary arterial thrombosis occurred. The prevalence of thrombosis is high in that population due to the hypoxemia that results in secondary polycythemia, and, consequently, higher risk for thrombosis. The chance of pulmonary arterial thrombosis is suggested to increase with age, probably due to the progression of endothelial dysfunction over time. 4 Thus, to a patient at low risk for bleeding, anticoagulation should be discussed, even before thrombosis manifests.\n\n The patient was medicated for heart failure, and oral anticoagulation was initiated even before the manifestation of pulmonary arterial thrombosis. He remained stable for 10 years, and, during which, his medication was optimized with the later introduction of pulmonary vasodilators. These drugs are essential to treat the Eisenmenger syndrome, improving functional class, increasing tolerance to exercise and improving performance on the 6-minute walking test. 5 Despite adequate drug treatment, our patient's clinical status progressively worsened, and he died due to disease complications (heart failure and pulmonary arterial thrombosis).\n\n This case shows the importance of the early diagnosis of ASD, allowing the repair of the congenital defect timely, before complications occur.", "qa": [["80_1539330_2_1", "What are the symptoms and complications associated with Eisenmenger syndrome?\n", "Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with several complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary and systemic thrombosis, hemoptysis, renal dysfunction, cerebral abscess, gout, and biliary lithiasis.

However, a small subset of patients exhibited a phenotypically lichenoid photodermatitis and a lymphocytic interface dermatitis with basal vacuolization and keratinocyte apoptosis upon histopathology. Only a handful of cases describing similar lichenoid eruptions after vandetanib use have been reported, most of which developed within a few weeks after exposure. [5] [6] [7] [8] We present a patient with a late-onset lichenoid photodermatitis that began 5 months after initiation of vandetanib therapy.\n\n A 61-year-old African-American man with Fitzpatrick type IV skin was referred to our dermatology department with a 1-month history of painful and severe sunburn. In 2002, he had medullary thyroid cancer diagnosed and underwent total thyroidectomy with adjuvant radiation. Despite initial treatment, he experienced recurrent metastatic disease involving his lungs, liver, and bones. He subsequently was started on vandetanib therapy at 300 mg daily in December 2012.\n\n Approximately 5 months after initiation of vandetanib, a painful, erythematous eruption developed in sun-exposed regions after gardening outdoors. In the clinic, he had multiple vesicles, erosions, and scaly pink papules over his sun-exposed face, chest, upper back, and dorsal forearms (Fig 1, A-C) . No additional medications had been added to his regimen since beginning vandetanib therapy, and his only treatment was topical silver sulfadiazine; he denied taking any other known photosensitizing medications. A rheumatoid factor assay and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were both markedly elevated, but a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and antinuclear antibody test were all within normal limits. The patient denied any myalgias or muscle weakness. Skin biopsy specimens were taken from representative areas.\n\n Three specimens had similar histopathologic findings that included orthohyperkeratosis, mild hypergranulosis, mild spongiosis, basal vacuolization, and scattered dyskeratotic cells. A bandlike lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present in the papillary dermis. Melanin granules were seen both within macrophages and freely in the papillary dermis (Fig 2) . Lichenoid photodermatitis during treatment with vandetanib has been described in a few case reports and a small case series. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] One author hypothesized that photodermatitis was related to deposition of drug or drug metabolites within the dermis. 6 However, the exact mechanism of vandetanibinduced photosensitivity remains unclear. In vitro studies have found that vandetanib has a low molecular weight and polycyclic structure similar to other known photosensitizing agents and that vandetanib may exert its photosensitizing effects through induction of reactive oxygen species, DNA cleavage, and cell apoptosis. 9 It has also been shown that vandetanib inhibits the ABCG2 transporterassociated protein, which suggests a porphyrialike mechanism. 10 Although the cutaneous porphyrias, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, can be associated with a chronic lichenoid photodermatitis, there are no studies to our knowledge evaluating porphyrin levels in patients taking vandetanib.\n\n Given the findings from the aforementioned in vitro studies, it would be reasonable to extrapolate that phototoxicity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vandetanib-related photosensitivity. However, phototoxicity typically develops within hours to days. With regard to the spectrum of cutaneous side effects of vandetanib, the most commonly reported photosensitive eruptions manifest within a few days to weeks as severe sunburns with erythematous desquamation.", "qa": [["59_8646008_0_1", "What are the common cutaneous side effects associated with vandetanib therapy?\n", "The common cutaneous side effects associated with vandetanib therapy include folliculitis, palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis, desquamation, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, and photosensitization.

Solutions to the above equations are the ultimate aim of our derivation.\n\n We assume that the bubble oscillation may be decomposed into N axisymmetric oscillation modes including the radial pulsation (mode 0), translation (mode 1), and shape modes (modes of order n > 1). Due to the parametric behavior of nonspherical bubble dynamics, some of the modes can oscillate at frequencies different from the driving frequency. Therefore, in the general case, the bubble surface can be represented as\n\n where R 0 is the bubble radius at rest, s n is the complex amplitude of the nth mode, \u03c9 n is the angular frequency of the nth mode, \u03bc = cos \u03b8 , and P n is the Legendre polynomial of order n.
