It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Finally and most recently Klare et al, [54] published in 2019 their results for another CADe developed using WL endoscopy and tested in a small prospective study including 55 patients, this CADe showed a polyp detection rate of 50.9% and an adenoma detection rate of 29.1%.\n\n As a summary of the available published data, AI is a very promising tool to increase colon polyps' detection. In other Figure 1 : The system presented the probability of the presence of polyps as a percentage in the upper left corner of the endoscopic image. When the probability exceeded the cut-off set at 75%, the CAD system warned of the possibility of the presence of polyps by changing the color in the four corners of the endoscopic image to red.

For sure more work is needed to decide about the best and the most practical CADe that can be used in screening colonoscopy.\n\n Another use of AI technology during colonoscopy is to offer diagnostic assistance: CADx. The ability to diagnose small polyps in-situ via \"optical-biopsy\" may reduce unnecessary polypectomies of non-neoplastic polyps. In other terms, this may help to apply the application of \"diagnose and disregard\" strategy for hyperplastic polyps.\n\n Misawa et al [12] developed a CADx system based on endocytoscopy (EC). This system automatically provides highly accurate diagnosis in real-time as endoscopists concurrently take EC images. Vital stain such as methylene blue is required to visualize glandular structural and cellular atypia. In contrast, the endocytoscopic vascular pattern can effectively evaluate microvessel findings using EC with NBI (EC-NBI) without using any dye. EC-NBI has shown a highly accurate diagnostic ability, similar to other modalities allowing endoscopists to use it more easily without the cumbersome dye staining during colonoscopy. [55] The custom software is called EndoBRAIN (Cybernet Systems Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To develop this CAD system, an image-database was created using 1079 EC-NBI images (431 non-neoplasms and 648 neoplasms) from 85 lesions colorectal lesions that had been detected during colonoscopy using EC and subsequently resected between December 2014 and April 2015. From this image-database, 979 images (381 non-neoplasms, 598 neoplasms) were used for ML and the remaining randomly selected 100 images were used for ML. The CAD system provided diagnosis of 100% (100/100) of the validation samples with a diagnosis time of 0.3 s per image.\n\n The major limitation of this system was that it cannot diagnose cancers and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), because there were few EC-NBI images of invasive cancers and SSA/Ps for training.

Arimoclomol only acts on cells under stress in which HSF-1 is already activated and does not induce the heat shock response in unstressed cells (40) , thereby avoiding the side effects associated with widespread, nontargeted heat shock response activation. Indeed, previous examination of the effects of arimoclomol in mice has shown that treatment with arimoclomol has no detectable effect on nonstressed cells and there was no increase in HSP expression in any tissue studied (including spleen, heart, brain, spinal cord, nerve, and muscle).\n\n Here, we took a three-step translational approach to test whether heat shock response augmentation may be a potential therapy for sIBM. We first established robust in vitro models representing the degenerative and inflammatory components of sIBM. Primary rodent myotube cultures were induced to overexpress human b-APP by transfection of the wild-type human gene, or cultures were exposed to the inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). In these models, muscle cells developed several key IBM-like pathological features, which were used as outcome measures to examine the therapeutic potential of arimoclomol in IBM. Having established the beneficial effects of arimoclomol in vitro, we next tested its ability to ameliorate sIBM-like pathology in mice overexpressing mutant valosin-containing protein (VCP; p97 in mouse). These transgenic mice model the degenerative disorder multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), which has a phenotypic spectrum that includes inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone, and frontotemporal dementia (41) . Although these mice are a model of the genetic rather than sporadic form of IBM, they do develop progressive muscle weakness and pathological hallmarks of inclusion body myopathy. In addition, we also undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, proof-of-concept trial of arimoclomol versus placebo for the treatment of sIBM in human patients. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of arimoclomol and to gather exploratory efficacy data.\n\n \n\n We first established accurate in vitro models of sIBM-like pathology in which primary rat myoblast cultures were either transfected with b-APP or exposed to inflammatory cytokines. For both cell culture models, we first undertook a series of titration experiments to determine the optimal conditions; the effects of different DNA and Lipofectamine ratios or different cytokine concentrations on b-APP and Ab40 and Ab42 expression were examined at different stages in vitro.\n\n Transfection of primary rat myocytes with full-length human b-APP increased the expression of b-APP and its toxic cleavage product amyloid b-42 (Ab42) and led to the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, a hallmark of sIBM, containing b-APP, ubiquitin, and TDP-43 among other proteins (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1 , A to E). Treatment with arimoclomol after transfection significantly reduced the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions (P < 0.01; n = 3; Fig. 1C ). Additionally, b-APP overexpression increased the expression of MHC-I, a characteristic feature of sIBM muscle, and the proapoptotic protein caspase-3 ( fig. S1 , F and G). Exposure of cultured rat myocytes to IL-1b and TNFa was also associated with elevated expression of b-APP and Ab42, although in the absence of inclusion body formation. Increased MHC-I expression was also reproduced in the cytokine-exposed cultures ( fig. S1G ). Similar results were obtained with IFN-g.\n\n Overexpression of b-APP or exposure to inflammatory mediators resulted in cytoplasmic mislocalization of the C terminus of TDP-43 from the nucleus (Fig. 1 , D to G), which is a key pathological feature of sIBM patient muscle.

This leads to the idea that this increase in magnesium concentration is a component part of the mechanism of action of antidepressants.\n\n Levine et al. [18] found no significant changes in plasmatic and CSF calcium and magnesium concentrations in patients with depression. Our data also show a lack of significant changes in plasmatic calcium and magnesium levels in medium and mild MD, but erythrocyte magnesium was significantly decreased. In patients with severe MD (Hamilton score > 23), the concentration of total plasmatic magnesium was lower compared to the control group, but it was not changed in mild to moderate depression. We think that the heterogeneity of data about variations in plasmatic and tissue concentrations of magnesium (and other cations) in patients with depression is due to the different degrees of depression (in some studies with MD and in others with different depressive states). The studies were performed at different moments in the evolution of the disease and the effects of therapy on the concentrations of bivalent cations were not investigated.\n\n In some experimental models in animals, magnesium decreased the intensity of the depression. These experimental models do not reproduce human depression. Also, the ways of evaluating depressive symptoms in animals are not the same as in human MD but some mechanisms are close enough or similar.\n\n Magnesium decreased post-traumatic depression following different traumatic brain injuries in rats [19] . Animals that receive MgSO 4 30 minutes after injury, had a significantly decreased incidence and severity of depression. In this study, locomotion in an open field was considered to reflect general activity and a decrease in mobility was considered an indicator of depressed behavior. Rats fed with a Mg deficient diet for 48 days (Mg content < 15 mg/kg/day) and demineralized water show magnesium deficiency, associated with depression-like and anxietyrelated behavior. The anxiolytic mechanism of magnesium is linked with its action at the level of NMDA receptors. There are at least two aspects of this action: the action to partially block the calcium channel linked with the NMDA receptor; the action on the glycine B site in the NMDA receptor. This magnesium action is antagonized by D-serine (100 nmol/mouse). D-serine significantly decreases the anxiolytic effect of magnesium [20] .\n\n Studies of magnesium concentrations in rats that developed depressive disturbances after traumatic brain injury (TBI) observed that magnesium administration 30 minutes after TBI reduced the incidence of depression. In these animals, locomotion (tested with open field tests for exploratory activity) decreased in animals that developed depressive and anxious symptoms and that had an increased degree of post traumatic disorder (alleviated by magnesium). Magnesium had an immediate effect on depressed rats' motor activity.\n\n Spasov et al. [21] showed that a magnesiumdeficient diet in rats is associated with depressionlike and anxiety behavior and that Mg-l-aspartate and MgCl 2 \u00d7 6H 2 O in combination with pirydoxine led to a correction of behavioral disturbances in those rats. Iezhitsa et al. [22] showed that magnesium administration associated with vitamin B6 corrected depression-like behavioral disturbances in rats with chronic alcoholism. Some experimental studies have shown that concomitant administration of magnesium increased the effect of imipramine on immobility in stress-induced depressionlike behavior in forced swim tests on mice [23] . Compared to mice fed with a normal diet, mice receiving a low magnesium diet for 4-8 weeks show an increased immobility time in the forced swim test. This fact is considered as an indicator of depressive states even if it is not identical to human depression [24] . Therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant such as desimipramine decreases immobility after a hypoglycemic diet. Magnesium depletion increases anxiety and depression in rodents.\n\n Because anhedonia (lack of activity to pleasurable stimuli) is a major feature of depression, involvement of the brain reward system is very important [25] . One of the pathways that magnesium and other bivalent cations might influence in the evolution of MD and the effects of antidepressant medication, is through action on the brain reward system. We tested the influence of different Mg 2+ doses on the reward system (RS), using conditioned place preference (CPP). Our data shows that magnesium (0.2 mM/kg/day) moderately increases CPP in rats, which proves a stimulation of the reward system [26] .\n\n The results of Lawley and Kantak [27] and our data support the idea that magnesium moderately stimulates the reward system. MgCl 2 induced place preference in rats at 15 mg/kg [27] , respectively 0.2 mM/kg i.p. [26] . Our data showed a moderate stimulation of RS by magnesium (290.6 \u00b1 27 s time spent in a conditioned compartment before magnesium treatment and 363.3 \u00b1 16 s after magnesium treatment, p < 0.05) which reflects stimulation of the RS and is a measure for pleasant stimulation. We consider that magnesium stimulation of the RS is an important issue for treating anhedonia in patients with MD and increasing intracellular concentrations of magnesium is a component of the mechanism of action of antidepressants.", "qa": [["80_1235493_1_1", "How does magnesium deficiency affect depressive symptoms in rats?\n", "Studies have shown that rats fed with a magnesium-deficient diet exhibit depression-like and anxiety-related behavior.

Routinely, participants comment about how real and emotionally intense they found the conversation to be, how anxious they felt, and how relieved they are to have the experience behind them. By creating this \"breathing space\" and validating the emotional world of the practitioners, facilitators send a clear educational message that anxiety and vulnerability in these conversations is normal, expected, and worthy of reflection.\n\n The debriefing discussion focuses next on the manner in which information about Billy's medical condition has been shared with the parents. This particular physician has been very direct and forthcoming in the way she presents Billy's condition and prognosis to the parents, though clearly she has been compassionate at the same time. Facilitators and participants discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of this directness. The tension in the conversation between wanting to be truthful, while at the same time supporting the hope of family members, is explored.\n\n After these initial reflections, the actors who portrayed Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien join the discussion and are invited to offer feedback to the practitioners. They describe the directness of the physician's approach as \"a bit jarring,\" but they also say they appreciated the honesty and compassion shown by both clinicians. They discuss how it might have helped if the physician had \"eased into\" the communication of bad news by reviewing the sequence of events from the time of the drowning incident up until the present, because they had only recently arrived at the hospital and this was their first contact with the clinical team.\n\n Then, one of the facilitators comments on a juncture in the conversation when \n\n Hidden curriculum: The value premises underlying the culture of medicine suggest that . . . 8\n\n \n\n \n\n Clinicians must be comfortable with their own imperfection and vulnerability.\n\n There is sufficient safety and trust for learners to explore matters of personhood and professional integrity. Outcome is more important than process.\n\n Attention to process can be critical to the achievement of successful outcomes. Hierarchy is necessary. Hierarchy can hinder optimal learning across disciplinary lines and between less and more experienced clinicians.\n\n Hierarchical structure and rules are suspended so that knowledge can be encountered on its own merits and not unduly influenced by power, authority, or level of experience. Medicine finds its appropriate niche in interdisciplinary practice and optimal collaboration with patients and families.\n\n The knowledge and insights of patients, family members, and clinicians from multiple disciplines are afforded appropriate status and authority in the learning process.\n\n she observed the nurse saying to the parents, \"He's still Billy.\" These words were spoken twice, first in response to Mrs. O'Brien's anguished question, \"Can he hear us?\" and then a bit later, with rather more conviction, as the nurse prepares the parents for seeing their son enveloped by the machines that are keeping him alive. The nurse responds by sharing that he was uncertain about the appropriateness of this comment and that he \"started second guessing\" himself.\n\n He opens himself to group feedback by revealing, \"I didn't know if that was the right thing to say or not.\"\n\n In response to his uncertainty, one of the faculty facilitators observes that, in her view, \"you brought Billy right in that room-that was very powerful.\" She is followed in her comments by the parent facilitator, who adds, \"I thought that was a very effective comment-you gave expertise back to those parents.\" Another participant agrees, reminding colleagues that in nursing report or rounds, Billy could easily be referred to as \"the comatose patient in bed 12.\" The actors explain that they appreciated both practitioners consistently referring to their son by name, and that the nurse's words, \"He's still your little boy \" helped them to remember that, even in this alien and intimidating intensive care setting, they still had a vitally important role to play as parents.\n\n It is important to note that the very words that may have been most important to the parents are the same words that this nurse finds himself doubting and worrying about in terms of their correctness. As faculty facilitators, we have observed that when practitioners experience their own words emerging from a place of authenticity in these conversations, when they speak spontaneously without searching cognitively for what they imagine to be the \"right words,\" they often feel uncertain and wonder whether they have said the wrong thing.\n\n There is an important kind of moral inquiry happening here.

Malpositioning of the implant may lead to an increased risk of postoperative complications such as dislocation, restricted range of motion, polyethylene wear, and loosening. Impingement of the prosthetic femoral neck on the polyethylene cup liner occurring in hip motion can be a causative factor leading to these complications. Achievement of optimal implant positioning is critical for the prevention of these complications.\n\n A number of studies have proposed optimum alignment of the acetabular cup. Lewinnek et al 1 defined the \"safe zone\" of cup alignment as 40\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0 of inclination and 15\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0 of anteversion. In clinical practice, use of a computer-assisted navigation system during THA has been shown to help achieve consistent and accurate positioning of the acetabular component. However, only a few studies have examined optimization of the prosthetic alignment on the femoral side.\n\n Several studies have reported that the postoperative antetorsion (AT) measurement for the femoral stem inserted without navigation showed wide variability in the measured values.

Several studies have reported that the postoperative antetorsion (AT) measurement for the femoral stem inserted without navigation showed wide variability. The current authors developed a simple instrument, the Gravity-guide (G-guide), for intraoperative assessment of stem AT and adjustment. They evaluated the effectiveness of the G-guide with postoperative computed tomography (CT) examination. Ninety patients (96 hips) who underwent primary THA using the G-guide for stem adjustment were evaluated. The G-guide consists of 2 parts: one attached to the lower leg and the other attached to the handle of the rasp. The G-guide was used to evaluate the AT at the time of inserting the final rasp. In addition, the AT value in the G-guide evaluation system required correction by the angle obtained in the preoperative epicondylar view. Intraoperative stem AT was defined as the sum of the intraoperative G-guide value and the correction angle. Postoperative AT was evaluated by CT examination. The discrepancy between the intra-and postoperative measurements was 4.6\u00b0\u00b14.1\u00b0. Acceptable accuracy with discrepancy of less than 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 was achieved in 66 (69%) hips and 85 (89%) hips, respectively. The use of the G-guide could effectively reduce the variability of stem anteversion compared with manual adjustment. This study proved the effectiveness of the newly developed G-guide system in intraoperative stem AT adjustment.\n\n [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(2):e271-e275.] alignment. Jolles et al 6 reported multiple predisposing factors for dislocation after the THA procedure and showed that the dislocation rate increased when the combined anteversion value was outside the range of 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Based on the results of a computerized 3-dimensional model analysis, Widmer and Zurfluh 7 proposed the formula (cup anteversion + 0.7 stem AT) as the optimal combination for positioning of both components to calculate the combined anteversion value and defined the ideal value to be 37.3\u00b0 to avoid implant-on-implant impingement.\n\n Determination of femoral stem AT is an important predictor of the longevity of THA, as well as cup alignment. In a previous study by the current authors, they evaluated the AT and combined anteversion values in patients who underwent THA using image-free navigation for the cup with manual adjustment of the stem. 8 Consequently, the AT and combined anteversion values showed wide variability. To attain consistency in stem AT, the authors developed a simple instrument, the Gravity-guide (G-guide), for intraoperative assessment and adjustment. They have used this instrument in their clinical practice. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Gguide with postoperative CT examination.\n\n This study was approved by the institutional review board ( (Figure 1) . During THA, a modified Hardinge approach was used with the patients in the lateral decubitus position in all cases.\n\n Intraoperatively, the G-guide was used to evaluate the AT at the time of inserting the final rasp. The part of the G-guide attached to the lower leg is used to ascertain perpendicularity of the lower leg axis. The other part provides information for the orientation of the final rasp.

Lymphangiogram revealed lymphatic channels were poorly visualized, however lymphatic channel seems to be patent as activity was normal. Lymphoschintography and genetic screening were not done due to nonavailability.\n\n Lymphedema is caused by a dysfunction of the lymphatic system. Lymphangiography demonstrates hypoplasia or aplasia of lymphatic channels. It provokes dis\u00fbguration and disabling swelling, mostly localized at the extremities. Primary congenital lymphedema also known as Milroy disease is the rarest cause of lymphedema. The disease is hereditary and analysing the family with this disease showed that it has autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. The genetic basis of most cases of Milroy disease has not been established. 4 The gene responsible for this condition is identified in the region 5q34-q35. It is located to the telomeric part of chromosome 5q. This region contains the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR3 (FLT-4). The gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which is speci\u00fbc for lymphatic vessels. In early embryogenesis the gene is expressed in all vessels but thereafter, expression is limited to adult lymphatic vessels. Defective VEGFR3 signaling due to Mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR3 (FLT-4) seems to be the cause of congenital hereditary lymphedema in some cases. 2 In studying the pathology of the disease, McGuire and Zeek (1932), reported the results of biopsy in a typical case. Microscopy of a portion of the skin and subcutaneous tissue showed a normal epidermis but a marked condensation of the superficial portion of the dermal papillary layer composed of fine collagen fibrils which in some places were undergoing hyalinization; oedema was more pronounced in the dermis, and this, together with an increase of collagen fibres, produced a great increase in the proportion of dermis to epidermis. There was a considerable sprinkling of lymphocytes related to the capillaries and venules. The subcutaneous tissue was also thickened, consisting of masses of oedematous fatty tissue and pools of colourless fluid not contained within definite limiting boundaries. 5 The age of onset of clinical features varies in the different families recorded. It may be present in the prenatal period or may develop after birth upto puberty. The oedema begins in the toes, gradually spreads up the limb, but never extends above the level of the inguinal ligament, where it is sharply demarcated; it may remain at lower levels, especially joints, for long periods. At first the oedema pits readily on pressure, though later the tissues become more indurated and thickened, and is reduced by rest with elevation of the limb. One or both limbs may be affected.

This neural basis makes effective restoration of hand function in moderate to severe stroke patients become extremely challenging. Furthermore, the resulting 'none-use-decay' can cause further decrease of the hand function. Although full of challenges, some of the research findings demonstrate that hand function recovery in this population is still feasible, with evidence showing both feasibility in intervention-induced changes in behaviour 23 24 and neural plasticity measures. 20 We therefore focus on hand function recovery in the group of stroke survivors with moderate to severe impairment in this systematic review.\n\n According to our knowledge of the literature, ample summary of the efficacy of various interventions for upper limb function rehabilitation in stroke patients can be found in published systematic reviews. Most of these reviews evaluate the efficacy of a single category of therapeutic technique, such as CIMT, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] robot-assisted therapy, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] bilateral training, 36 37 task-oriented training, 38 exercise therapy, 39 functional electrical stimulation (FES), 40 41 orthotics, 42 43 mental practice, 44 45 mirror therapy, 46 47 action observation, 48 non-invasive cerebral stimulation, 49-52 brain-computer interface, 53 54 virtual reality, 42 home-based therapy programmes 55 and so on. There are also some comprehensive systematic reviews on general function treatment of upper limb after stroke [56] [57] [58] or other specific problems, such as motor dysfunction, 59 60 sensory impairment, 61 spasticity, 62 63 decreased quality of life, 64 and shoulder pain and subluxation. [65] [66] [67] In addition, other important issues of upper limb rehabilitation after stroke, like timing of intervention, 68 dose of training, 69 effects of severity on motor recovery, 24 outcome measures [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] and predictors of functional restoration 76 77 were systematically reviewed as well. However, much less attention has been paid to the systematic review of hand function rehabilitation after moderate to severe stroke. [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] Fortunately, with growing attention to this research field in recent decades, an increased number of clinical trials that focus on moderate to severe stroke patients is now available, involving various intervention methods, like electromyography (EMG)-triggered electrical stimulation, 84 tDCS, 85 robot-assisted movement training, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 86 and mirror therapy. 87 Although with relatively small sample sizes, a review of these reported works will provide insight for the future direction along this line of research and thus may further impact future clinical practice for this large population.\n\n Comprehensive overview of hand motor function rehabilitation in individuals with moderate to severe stroke has long been neglected not only in systematic reviews but also in the main guidelines for stroke rehabilitation. In the most recent Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery released by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association in 2016, we can only locate recommendations for the treatment of upper extremity activity but can hardly find any evidence-based suggestions for hand function training. 88 The 2015 update of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations: Stroke Rehabilitation Practice Guidelines has provided a series of recommendations on the management of upper extremity following stroke, including the restoration of sensorimotor function, and relief of spasticity and pain. Regarding the hand function rehabilitation after stroke, limited recommendations are scattered among evidence for other forms of upper extremity interventions, such as FES and CIMT for hand motor function, botulinum toxin for hand spasticity and range of motion, and exercise and massage for hand oedema. 89 Similar problems can be found in stroke rehabilitation guidelines in UK and Australia, which mainly provide recommendations on upper extremity management while lacking a detailed description of the current evidence on hand function recovery. 90 91 The absence of systematic evidence in guidelines for hand rehabilitation following stroke greatly increases the difficulty of clinical work.\n\n In short, a standardised systematic review on the effectiveness of interventions is warranted to improve hand motor function in individuals with moderate to severe stroke.

Extension at distal joints, such as hand opening, primarily depends on the function of the corticospinal track projected from the lesioned hemisphere. The resulting \"none-use-decay\" can further decrease hand function.

Their histology spectrum and serological features are similar to those of testicular primaries. However, the unique association of MNSGCT with haematological malignancies [2] and the Klinefelter syndrome [3] as well as their different natural history and prognosis suggest that they constitute a distinct clinico-pathological entity different from that of their testicular counterparts and therefore require specific treatment [4] .\n\n Because of the relatively small number of patients in reported series, the optimal approach to MNSGCT has not been defined. This retrospective study was undertaken to review our experience with malignant MNSGCT treated with modern cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in three university hospitals in Spain.\n\n We reviewed the medical records of all patients with MNSGCT treated from 1978 to 1995 in the three hospitals. The study criteria for inclusion were: histological diagnosis of non-seminomatous germinal cell cancer; involvement of mediastinal structures; an absence of testicular tumour determined by physical examination and ultrasound and primary treatment with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma of the mediastinum were included if they had elevated serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or a beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (BHCG).\n\n All patients were evaluated prior to treatment by medical history, physical exam, complete blood count and serum chemistry, chest X-ray and, since 1980, CTscan of thorax and abdomen, and tumour markers, AFP and BHCG. Patients were treated with a cisplatin combination chemotherapy of adequate platinum dose-intensity: PVB (9), BEP (6), POMB/ACE (4), VIP (6) and BOMP/EPI (2) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Patients with partial response and negative tumour markers were scheduled for residual mass surgery (RMS), and those with viable residual cancer received further consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with nonresponding or relapsed tumours and optimal functional status and life expectancy were offered salvage chemotherapy with VIP (4), POMB/ ACE (1), VAB-6 (2) or paclitaxel (3) [7, 9, 10] , Response criteria were defined as follows: a complete remission (CR) was recorded when serum tumour markers normalised and complete resolution of tumour masses occurred. Partial remission (PR) was defined as a greater than 50% reduction in bidimensional tumour measurements and at least a 90% decline in tumour markers. Patients who could be rendered free of tumour with chemotherapy and RMS were coded ashaving no evidence of disease (NED). Progressive disease was defined as a greater than 25% increase in bidimensional tumour measurements or in tumour markers levels. Stable disease was defined as a less than 50% decrease or a greater than 25% increase in bidimensional tumour measurements or stable tumour marker values Survival was calculated from the day of diagnosis to date of last follow-up or death. The product-limited survival was determined using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Potential relationships between outcome and dichotomous variables were compared with the log-rank test.\n\n Twenty-seven patients were identified during the study. Only one patient had an upfront complete surgical resection. Fourteen patients had disease confined to the mediastinum, seven had lung disease and five had extrapulmonary disease (two brain and three liver). Nine patients had negative AFP levels at diagnosis, four patients had levels < 1000 ng/ml, four had values 1000-10000 ng/ml and six had values > 10000 ng/ml. In four patients AFP values at presentation were not known. BHCG was negative in 14 patients and eight patients had levels below 1000 mUI/ml, in five patients BHCG levels were not measured before treatment. Fifteen patients had LDH values more than 1.5 times the upper normal limit and none had levels over 10 times the normal limit. In seven patients, LDH levels were not recorded. Other patient characteristics are summarised in Table 1 .\n\n Eleven patients (40.7%) were rendered disease-free with initial treatment.

Dexamethasone is a pharmaceutical and long-acting form of corticosteroids (half-life of the plasma is 110-120 minutes and the biological half-life is 36-45 hours). One of the most useful methods is intraoral injection of dexamethasone, which has already been reported to have an effect on pain and edema caused by dental surgery similar to that of intramuscular injection (15). Therefore, it has a significant effect on postoperative pain and edema. Even mucosal injections are better than muscle injections due to less complications and equal effects (16) .\n\n Despite the benefits mentioned, this drug has different short-term and long-term complications (17, 18) . The most common side effects of dexamethasone that appear in the short term include euphoria, insomnia, decreased or blurred vision, frequent urination, irritation, excessive thirst, numbness, mental weakness, pain and swelling, allergy, infection at the injection site, pain at the injection site, restlessness, skin rash, redness, eye sensitivity to light, gastrointestinal ulcer and the most important complications are seizure, heart failure, bloody stools, heart rate disorder, muscle pain and muscle weakness, menstrual disorder, nausea and vomiting, pain in the back of the arms, headache, swelling of the legs, etc. (19) . Due to its anti-inflammatory effects, dexamethasone is one of the most widely used drugs in Iran and an overdoing process of consuming it has taken place. (20) .\n\n Given the complications, new research suggests the use of complementary medicine, especially herbal medicine, as a low-cost treatment with minimal side effects. Ginger is one of the most widely used medicinal plants, which has been introduced in ancient medicine as an anti-inflammatory herb (21) . The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of ginger are well known and are influenced by substances such as gingerol in this plant. Its anti-cancer properties have also been proven inside the laboratory. In the process of drying ginger, gingerol is converted to shogoal (22) .\n\n Recent research has proven shogoal's properties in preventing Alzheimer's disease. The active compounds of this plant, such as zingerone, shogaol, gingerdion, gingerol have the ability to inhibit the production of prostaglandins and nitrite oxide and even interleukins involved in inflammation. In addition, and more specifically, the enzymes that produce these inflammatory mediators are controlled by the active ingredients of ginger (23) .\n\n With regard to the above, and that wisdom teeth surgery is one of the most commonly used traumatic dentistry actions that causes a patient significant inflammation and pain, and on the other hand, suggested strategies to reduce this distressing pain are the use of steroidal anti-inflammatory and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which they themselves cause serious damage, including digestive, cardiovascular and bone damage; therefore, considering the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of ginger extract which is a medicinal herb with high efficiency and low side effects, it seems that if it is effective, it can replaced a harmful steroidal drug. Therefore, this study, by comparing the effect of topical application of ginger aquaalcoholic extract with topical injection of dexamethasone 1/6 mg, intends to introduce this method, in case of efficiency, as an alternative to dexamethasone injection.\n\n WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE/MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE VOLUME 15 ISSUE 9, NOVEMBER 2017\n\n Materials and Methods 45 patients referred to the Bushehr faculty of Dentistry clinic in 2017 who had double mandibular wisdom teeth and were referred to have a simple tooth extraction (without surgery) or extraction with surgical procedures.

Furthermore, these frameworks theorize about the causes of disease, so they influence how researchers conceptualize and operationalize the determinants of health.\" [25] . In assessing the impact of the IBCERCC report, Tesh's discussion of hidden arguments serves as a framework for understanding the tensions between the environmental breast cancer movement and adherents of more dominant narratives of epistemological objectivity and institutional change as incrementally building on extant scientific knowledge of environmental risks. For Brown, dominant pluralist paradigms can be deployed to stifle more substantive actions capable of addressing political economic drivers of environmental chemical contamination [5, 25] . Regarding concerns over non-voluntary chemical exposure, using the diagnostic frame of preventing breast cancer as a sole matter of \"innovative science\" could delay action by absolving stakeholders such as industry and federal regulators of responsibility for addressing immediate issues like substantive TSCA reform (and health-protective implementation), let alone the current political-economic trends toward weakening federal regulatory policy and research capacity. If a lack of science is the diagnostic or problem frame, the prognostic frame or solution is doing more science. Such framing elides politics and perhaps most importantly private sector agendas and interests inside federal regulatory agencies in the U.S.\n\n As discussed above, almost all the academic and federal interviewees discussed the impact of government budget crises on hindering the success of implementing the recommendations of the IBCERCC. For the advocates, select academics and federal interviewees, social and policy change are generally understood to be power struggles. These interviewees were aware of the history of the breast cancer movement(s) that used non-institutional direct action, non-violent protest, and institutional (lobbying, public testimony, etc.) tactics to secure federal research funding. Thus, they perceived the importance of taking active and decisive responsibility for shaping the current state of scientific knowledge on breast cancer. These actors foresaw significant work ahead to make progress, invoking a conflict or power-based model of change, which the health social movements literature largely supports [5, 9, 10, 32, 33] .\n\n Some scientists and federal stakeholders interviewed adhered to pluralist models of social and political change, conceptualizing of science as speaking for itself. Here individuals pursue scientific research that may eventually be taken-up by policy makers and regulators [5, 34] . These interviewees appeared more resigned to budget constraints in the near future, in contrast to advocates who were more likely to focus on specific policies, reforming the EPA, or industry interests during interviews. While there were some exceptions, federal members and scientists conceptualized of institutional change from a more pluralist perspective, not drawing attention to industry behavior in a) producing growing volumes of carcinogens and endocrine disrupting chemicals or b) erecting barriers to adequate regulation, oversight, or monitoring of known harmful compounds. Many interviewees across all stakeholder groups discussed getting individuals in the general public information in order to better protect themselves, using consumer movements to shift policy towards protection, and voicing an \"all you can do is your part\" sentiment on multiple scales. One advocate expressed concern that younger generations were not willing to sacrifice and fight politically the way her generation had on breast cancer in the early 1980s. She felt resigned to the breast cancer movement shifting into a less radical, consumer-oriented movement among mothers concerned with purchasing safe products. This concern over the decline of a more politically engaged breast cancer movement was recently echoed by a scientist lamenting the closure of the BCERP grant program and lack of broad outcry in 2019. Thus, interviewees adhered to fundamentally conflicting conceptions of social, scientific, and political change.\n\n The short and long-term impacts of the IBCERCC report are mixed, with stakeholder assessments varying widely. In the challenging funding climate for federal research in 2014, committee members saw the continuation of the BCERP and a companion research center as important short-term outcomes of the IBCERCC. According to one federal interviewee, it is unusual for a Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) to function across federal agencies and bring agency staff together with scientists and advocates to share their work, tackle questions regarding funding allocation, and produce a collaborative set of future recommendations. However, as numerous interviewees noted, the power of this model and collaborative effort risk being lost without accountability, especially to public health oriented stakeholders. Just as interviewees had different understandings of barriers to the implementation of report recommendations, interviewee comments varied in their implicit models of change. To some committee members, it was not clear to them who or what entities were responsible for carrying out the recommendations. However, many advocates, select federal staff and scientists felt that they were responsible for \"carrying this on their backs\" to ensure it had impacts on research, policy, and funding. Looking at the impetus behind what ultimately became the IBCERCC, this assessment appears to be historically accurate. For some scientists, with the publication of the 2013 report, they considered their work on the committee done; they had assessed research funding and the scientific literature, stating that it is up to advocates, policy makers, and regulators to decide what to do with the science. The NBCC meanwhile has moved into advocating and supporting research they believe will produce the quickest and most effective breast cancer solutions, including preventative vaccines. NBCC's current focus is on finding medical solutions to breast cancer by 2020 [22] , in contrast to the focus on chemical exposures held by most other advocates interviewed.\n\n These stakeholder interviews reveal significant contrasts regarding how IBCERCC members, breast cancer researchers, advocates, and funders conceive of their roles in bringing about necessary changes to address breast cancer prevention. Most IBCERCC participants believed that the committee's mandate was worthwhile, though some believed that their goals had a slim chance of implementation, with one committee member guessing that only 10% of these types of reports had any impact. This assessment indicates that the IBCERCC, PCP, and IOM reports represent greater acknowledgment of the significance of environmental contributors to breast cancer by the federal government and large research establishments, long called for by groups within breast cancer movement(s). However, short and longer-term outcomes indicate that social movement advocates will need to continue to play a central role in driving institutional responses to the global prevalence of breast cancer. Integrating social science into multi-stakeholder scientific collaborations offers opportunities for examining underlying assumptions, implicit theories of change, and the identification how assumptions impact problem definitions, the scope of solutions considered, and the necessity of systems of accountability.\n\n Additional file", "qa": [["51_146811248_8_1", "How do hidden arguments and conceptual frameworks influence the research and understanding of disease causes and determinants?", "Hidden arguments and conceptual frameworks shape the questions asked by researchers, the methods they use to investigate those questions, and their theories about the causes of disease.

Appendicitis may be suspected, but the pain often is intermittent in intussusception rather than continuous.\n\n In the most common form of intussusception, ileocolic, a sausage-shaped mass may be palpable on the right side or in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Abdominal radiographs may show obstruction, and a mass also may be visible. Ultrasonography demonstrates bowel within bowel or a \"target.\" Ultrasonography is very accurate in detecting intussusceptions and is considered the test of choice.\n\n Treatment (and confirmation of the intussusception) is with an air contrast enema. Air is safer and cleaner than liquid and is more effective. If the enema fails, surgery must be performed to reduce the intussusception.\n\n Because the rash of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) may present after the onset of abdominal pain, severe acute pain can be the initial sign of the condition. HSP is a vasculitis that can be triggered by infection, medications, or even insect bites. The rash begins on the buttocks or extensor surfaces of the legs and may spread gastrointestinal acute abdominal pain peripherally. It can start as urticaria but progresses to \"palpable purpura.\"\n\n The intestine also shows purpuric lesions, and the edema and inflammation result in colicky pain. Children also may vomit with HSP, and the abdomen can be tender to palpation. The lesions can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or complications of intussusception or perforation. HSP usually affects children younger than 10 years of age, but it is rare in infants. HSP recurs in about one third of cases.\n\n Arthralgias or arthritis are seen in most cases, with the lower extremity large joints affected most often. HSP also can lead to nephropathy in up to 50% of the children. The renal involvement usually is mild and may present weeks after the abdominal pain.\n\n If the typical rash is seen, no testing is indicated. Ultrasonography or contrast radiographs of the intestines show the edematous lesions in the gut. Endoscopy demonstrates purpuric lesions. The white blood cell count can be increased, and markers of inflammation such as the sedimentation rate usually are elevated. Occasionally, there are no other signs of HSP apart from the abdominal pain, and the diagnosis may be made after observing purpuric lesions of the gastrointestinal tract on endoscopy.\n\n Treatment is supportive. In the case of severe joint or abdominal pain, prednisone can be used to decrease symptoms.\n\n Upper abdominal pain and tenderness, especially when associated with vomiting, are typical features of pancreatitis as well as many other diseases. To determine if pancreatitis is present, serum amylase or lipase must be measured. If concentrations of these enzymes are greater than three times the upper limit of normal, pancreatitis most likely is the cause of the symptoms. Normal values do not exclude the diagnosis.\n\n Pancreatitis arises from many different infections, medications, or trauma. Other causes include gallstones, abnormal ductular anatomy, systemic illness, and metabolic problems. The cause in any specific patient can be hard to determine, and finding the cause can be expensive. Therefore, in an isolated case, an exhaustive search is not necessary. Most children who experience acute pancreatitis do not suffer additional episodes.\n\n CT scan or ultrasonography can help diagnose pancreatitis as well as look for anatomic causes or gallstones. In recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, pancreaticsufficient cystic fibrosis should be excluded, along with genetic forms of pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be considered.\n\n Treatment is supportive. The patient may eat if food does not cause pain. Narcotics should be used for severe pain. Intravenous fluids and intravenous acid suppression are used. If vomiting continues with gut \"rest,\" a nasogastric tube can be used to decompress the stomach. In severe cases, patients require intensive care due to the fluid shifts and hypotension accompanying necrotic pancreatitis.\n\n Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain can signify a peptic ulcer. These lesions usually occur in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. In severe cases, bleeding or perforation can occur. Ulcer symptoms are common because many children have nonulcer dyspepsia, in which there is pain similar to that caused by an ulcer, but no ulcer is present.\n\n Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are an important cause of ulcers and dyspepsia in children.", "qa": [["68_26420696_2_1", "What are the common symptoms and diagnostic methods for intussusception in children?", "Common symptoms of intussusception in children include intermittent abdominal pain, often localized to the periumbilical region or right lower quadrant.
