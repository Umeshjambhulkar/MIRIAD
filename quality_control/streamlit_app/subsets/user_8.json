Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

It will triage women to the best place for their surgery and by ensuring the expertise available to perform the surgery reducing the rate of incomplete primary surgery, that has reflected into improve survival of ovarian cancer patients.\n\n The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) was the first diagnostic tool developed to help clinicians differentiate between benign and malignant ovarian tumours. Jacob et al. [1] described how it was developed and assesses its performance amongst a cohort 143 patients referred to a London hospital for elective surgical investigation of an adnexal mass. Each patient had five criteria assessed preoperatively: age, menopausal status, and clinical impression score (as determined by an experienced gynaecologist using all of the patient's preoperative clinical information; out of 5, high = more likely to be malignant), ultrasound score (out of 5, high = more likely to be malignant), and CA-125 level.\n\n Following surgery, it was determined that 101 of the patients had benign masses and 42 had malignant tumours. Patients in the malignant group had a higher mean age, were more commonly post-menopausal, and had higher clinical impression scores, ultrasound scores and CA-125 levels than patients in the benign group; all of these differences were statistically significant. However, when used individually, the criteria had inadequate sensitivity and specificity for malignancy.\n\n Logistic regression analysis revealed that only menopausal status, ultrasound score and CA-125 levels were significantly and independently related to the likelihood ratio for malignancy. These three criteria were then combined to form the RMI: RMI = U \u00d7 M \u00d7 CA-125 U = 0 for ultrasound score of 0 = 1 for ultrasound score of 1 = 3 for ultrasound score of 2-5 M = 1 if premenopausal = 3 if postmenopausal When a cutoff score of 200 was used, the RMI showed excellent diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 97%. Patients with an RMI score in excess of 200 had 42 times the background risk of cancer, whilst those with a score less than 200 had 0.15 times the risk. The authors concluded that the RMI was a valuable tool for the preoperative assessment of benign and malignant adnexal masses, and that it gave a higher level of discrimination than could be achieved by individual criteria alone.\n\n Overall, this is a good study. The sample size was sufficiently large to allow statistically significant differences between groups to be seen. The criteria used for the RMI were not chosen at random, or with clinical intuition alone: the formula was derived using objective statistical methods (which are presented as an appendix of the manuscript).\n\n However, the RMI does not take into account any symptoms or signs of ovarian cancer: the clinical impression score was not found to be both statistically and independently related to the likelihood ratio for ovarian cancer, and so was disregarded from further calculations. However, the score was determined by only one gynaecologist and the method of calculation is not given, suggesting a high level of subjectivity. More thorough assessment of clinical features -perhaps using a checklist system -might have shown a stronger correlation with malignancy.\n\n Unlike menopausal status and CA-125 levels, the ultrasound score is subjective: it relies on the expertise of the examiner.

Animals with established tumors received 100 mg/kg GDC-0941 or the pharmaceutical vehicle once daily. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence, and mice were taken from the experiment when clinical impairment due to tumor progression was observed. Animals treated with GDC-0941 displayed delayed tumor growth that resulted in significantly longer survival (26.5 days; median) compared to control animals (23.5 days).\n\n Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor that is often resistant to standard therapy. Therefore novel treatment approaches intercepting critical regulatory pathways in cancer development and progression are warranted. Here we present first in vitro and in vivo evidence that the clinically available pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 displays potent anti-neoplastic activity in medulloblastoma and commends itself as a possible adjunct to current medulloblastoma treatment.\n\n Indeed in an orthotopic murine model of preestablished human medulloblastoma, treatment with GDC-0941 results in significant survival benefit. Humanized orthotopic models are key to evaluate tumor growth and drug efficacy in the context of a tumorspecific micro-environment. This is particularly true in brain tumors in which biodistribution of the drug is of additional interest. Thus to allow for recovery of the blood barrier, we delayed GDC-treatment for 1 week after medulloblastoma-installation. Such \"tumor growth delay\" studies also mimic the clinical situation of pre-established tumors more adequately and are of stronger evidence in drug testing than less stringent \"tumor inhibition\" studies based on concomitant tumor and drug inoculation. [34] . Still we observed significant impairment of tumor-growth after two weeks of GDC-therapy and provide first proof that treatment with the pan PI3K-inhibitor GDC-0941 shows anti-neoplastic efficacy in an orthotopic humanized medulloblastoma model even at a relatively low GDCdose compared to reports in other tumors [35] . For in vivo assessment of GDC-efficacy we chose MEB-Med-8A, a patient-derived human medulloblastoma line that based on its molecular and genetic characteristics corresponds to the most aggressive medulloblastoma group 3, which is characterized by c-myc amplification and isochromosome 17. MEB-Med-8a derived tumors also mimic the clinical presentation of this medulloblastoma variant by rapid and invasive growth that leads to animal death within 2-3 weeks [23, 30] . Despite aggressive tumor growth inside the spatially confined fossa cranii posterior housing cerebellum and brainstem, which control coordination of movement, balance, equilibrium and critical vital functions, oral administration of 100 mg/kg GDC-0941 corresponding to intermediate doses applied to patients in phase Ib studies [19, 20] resulted in suppressed medulloblastoma growth and significantly prolonged the survival of treated animals. Yet, for critical appraisal of delayed tumor progression after oral application of PI3K inhibitors, one also needs to consider anti-angiogenic activity as one of the potential underlying mechanisms. Further studies are clearly warranted to dissect the in vivo effects of GDC-0941 treatment on PI3K-activity or its downstream elements in the tumormass itsself versus the microtumorenvironment. Nonetheless, in our extensive in vitro analysis we authenticate that exposure to 1 \u03bcM GDC-0941 corresponding to patient plasma levels significantly diminishes viable cell numbers in three of four medulloblastoma lines to 50-65%. Only in D341 previously shown to be resistant to selected cytotoxic drugs 5 \u03bcM GDC-0941 were required to achieve this level of suppression [36, 37] . We based our choice of in vitro drug concentrations on the original publication characterizing GDC-0941 as a potent and selective inhibitor of class I PI3K kinase. In solid tumor cell lines including glioblastoma, cell proliferation was inhibited at IC50s of 0.28-0.95 \u03bcM [18] which corresponds to the reported GDC-0941 plasma levels in clinical phase I studies [19, 20] . In these dose escalation trials in patients with solid tumors, single doses of 15 to 600 mg GDC-0941 were applied. Plasma levels at doses not associated with grade 3/4 toxicites ranged from 1-10 \u03bcM during the first 12 h.", "qa": [["13_11404387_3_1", "What is the significance of medulloblastoma as a pediatric brain tumor and why is there a need for novel treatment approaches?", "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and is often resistant to standard therapy.

Taken in conjunction with the fact that poem was initially considered \"so scandalous by the licenser of the 1633 Poems\" that he refused to publish it in that volume (Pebworth, 2006) , line 46, to my mind, suggests that the speaker and his mistress are about to engage in adulterous sex. If this is the case, then Donne destabilizes male power in the poem by suggesting that the mistress is about to defy the authority of her husband by having sex with the speaker. While encouraging his mistress to be unfaithful to her husband, the speaker worries that she will also be unfaithful to him. The speaker voices concerns about women's sexual freedom and the threat this freedom poses to patriarchal society. His concerns echo attitudes toward female sexuality that were being expressed by medical writers in the early modern period. For example, Helkiah Crooke insists that women are \"more wanton and petulant than males,\" which makes it near impossible for men to trust them (Crooke qtd. in Hobby, 2001) . He warns that women, \"mad for lust,\" might \"invite men\" to their beds (qtd. in Hobby, 2001) . Along the same lines, physician John Sadler cautions men that the imaginative power [of women] at the time of conception... is of such force that it stamps the character of the thing imagined upon the child: so that the children of an adultresse may be like unto her own husband as though begotten by another man; which is caused through the force of the imagination which the woman hath of her own husband in the act of coition. (Sadler, 1636) Both Crooke and Sadler outline the problematics of female power: women are difficult to control, yet their sexual freedom threatens patriarchal ideas about family and kinship, which rest on \"descent through the male line\" (Park, 2006) . Likewise, Donne's speaker struggles to come to terms with his mistress's sexual freedom. On the one hand, he tries to convince his mistress to exercise her freedom and commit adultery. On the other hand, he recognizes the importance of fidelity-an early modern man could only be certain of his child's paternity by restricting his wife's sexual freedom. The speaker underscores the importance of fidelity when he cries \"my kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned\" . Infidelity, the speaker implies, threatens a man's family or \"kingdom.\" The speaker betrays his apprehensions about his mistress's infidelity when he says that her \"white robes\" are like those worn by \"heaven's angels\" and \"ill spirits\" . Although he claims that he will \"easily know/... these angels from an evil sprite,\" his explanation-a joke about penile erections and piloerection-suggests that he is actually unable to tell the difference between a faithful \"angel\" and an unfaithful \"sprite\" . 38 Moreover, the implication is that he is also unable to tell the difference between a child of his and the child of another. Essentially, the speaker highlights physics of conception, pregnancy, and childbirth, all of which emphasize the mother's reproductive contribution and power. The speaker, unsettled by his mistress's power and jealous of her reproductive abilities, says: \"Gems which you women use/Are like Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views\" . He inverts the myth of Atlanta and Hippomenes, suggesting that he feels emasculated by his mistress. Troubled by her procreative power, the speaker imagines himself dominating his mistress by excavating her body.\n\n When the speaker imagines himself delving into his mistress's body, he uses the language of geology, rather than the language of anatomy, to describe his actions. Thomas Greene argues that the speaker's actions are \"provocative\" because he does not reveal the anatomical objects that he discovers (Greene, 1989) .\n\n Instead, the speaker describes his discoveries in geological terms: Envisioning his mistress as a geological entity, the speaker imagines himself colonizing her. He aligns his anatomical exploration with exciting discoveries taking place in the New World. 39 Discovering her body's interior, the speaker suggests, is like a voyage into the \"new-found-land\" that will uncover \"precious stones\" .", "qa": [["26_80334083_11_1", "How does the speaker in the poem \"destabilize male power\" and challenge patriarchal society?\n", "The speaker in the poem challenges patriarchal society by encouraging his mistress to engage in adulterous sex, which defies the authority of her husband.

During root canal preparation procedures, the potential for instrument breakage is always present. When instrument breakage occurs, it immediately provokes despair, anxiety, and then the hope that nonsurgical retreatment techniques still exist to liberate the instrument from the canal [1] .\n\n Most of the stainless steel instruments fail by excessive torque and NiTi rotary files usually fracture because of torsional stress and cyclic loading. Fractured instrument itself may not cause treatment failure. However, the remaining fragment in the root canal can hinder proper preparation of root canal space. Masserann kit is one of many devices that have been proposed for removal of the fractured fragment [2] . In presence of separated instrument the outcome is affected. Fox et al. also concluded that failed cases were associated with intracanal broken instruments [3] . Broken separated instrument when retained might produce corrosion products in the canal and thereby leads to the endodontic failure [4] . The following case describes the clinical scenario of a separated intracanal instrument removal by means of Masserann kit.\n\n A 45 year old female was referred to us with a separated endodontic instrument in the calcified root canal of maxillary right lateral incisor [3] . An intentional root canal therapy was advised as a part of treatment plan for full mouth rehabilitation. During which the procedural accident had happened.\n\n On clinical examination, generalized tooth abrasion was found. Vitality test of tooth #12 revealed no response. On radiographic examination, a separated endodontic instrument was found in middle third of the root canal. The canal was also calcified and narrow ( Figure 1A ). Patient was informed about the instrument separation and removal of the fragment was chosen as the treatment plan.\n\n Masserann micro kit (Micro-Mega, Besanc\u00b8on, France) was used to retrieve the instrument. Initially a gates glidden drill and ultrasonic Kerr K-file tips (#15-20) were used to keep the broken instrument in its center and to cut a circumferential trough around the fragment ( Figures 1B and  1C ). The metal tube was then fitted over the 'freed' end of the fragment, to engage it by means of a central stylus that was screwed in position. The instrument was then removed from the canal (Figures 1D and 1E ). (Figures 2A-C) . Working length was established using a size 15 K-file (Mani, Huaxian, China). Root canal irrigation was done using warm 3% NaOCl solution and then 17% EDTA was used to fully negotiate the narrow, calcified root canal. Canal was prepared using hand up to size 45. Obturation was done using 2% guttapercha cones with lateral condensation technique. Access cavity was then sealed using hybrid composite (3M ESPE, St. Paul, USA). Early treatment goals were achieved without complication and patient was referred to prosthodontic department for final restoration.\n\n Procedural errors in endodontics can occur during the process of root canal treatment that can be a result of factors over which the operator may or may not have control. Stainless steel instruments usually fail by excessive amounts of torque and NiTi instruments break due to combined action of torsional stress and cyclic loading. Factors affecting failures are instrumentation technique, use of torque controlled motor, core dimension and surface conditioning of the instrument, rotation rate, radius of canal curvature, presence of straight line access and glide path to apical portion of the canal. Root canal instruments are indispensable for root canal space preparation. An instrument can fracture if its ultimate strength is exceeded, or when a crack has propagated to such a degree that the remaining cross section of the instrument is unable to bear the operating load. Smaller endodontic instruments (size 15, 20) are more prone to distortion as a result of stressing on their small cross sections. Fractured fragment itself may not cause treatment failure but its being stock within the root canal can prevent improper preparation and disinfection resulting in a negative effect on the treatment outcome [2] . Attempts to remove fractured instruments can lead to ledge formation, over enlargement and transportation of prepared root canal or can lead to perforation. Hence the clinician has to evaluate the options of attempting to remove the instrument, bypassing it or leave the fractured fragment in the canal. The decision making should be made with the consideration for pulp status, canal infection, canal anatomy, position of the fragment and the type of fractured instrument [5] [6] [7] . Most commonly used devices to remove the fractured instruments are: ultrasonic devices, extraction tubes (Masserann kit), Canal Finder system and manual instruments. The main determinant for removal of the fractured fragment is the location of the fragment in relation to the curvature of the root canal. If the fragment is situated coronal to the curve, removal of the fragment is possible; on the other hand if the separation occurs beyond the curvature the retrieval is deemed impossible. Removal of fractured fragment from the root canal requires manual skills, equipments, instruments and good knowledge of root canal anatomy [2, 8] . Recommended guidelines to retrieve the instruments are: 1. Obtain a visual access of the coronal end of the fragment; 2. Knowledge about the root canal anatomy; 3. Attempt to bypass the fragment at first stage; 4. Choosing the right armamentarium [2, 9, 10] .\n\n To prevent the unpleasant mishap of instrument separation from happening, proper measures have to be taken during the treatment, such as; 1. Whenever possible, straight-line access to the apical portion of the canal should be created; 2. Glide path to the working length has to be established using #10 and #15; 3. Recommended torque control motor has to be used for particular instruments; 4. The file has to be advanced slowly and gradually in the canal until the resistance is felt; 5. Use of rotary files in abruptly curved canals has to be avoided; 6. Greater safety margins have to be allowed for instruments used in conjunction with NaOCl due to detrimental effects of corrosion; and 7. Smaller instruments are prone to fracture hence they are recommended to be single used [2, 6, 11, 12] . Curved and narrow canals have a higher risk of instrument fracture than straight and wide canals. Since most stainless steel instruments fracture with excessive amount of torque, care has to be taken during negotiation and instrumentation of narrow, curved root canals. Various techniques and treatment modalities are available for instrument retrieval form root canal.

Using this animal model, we have shown previously that low-dose dexamethasone treatment transiently affects adrenal growth and expression of the rate-limiting enzyme P450 scc (Moritz et al. 2002) . Interestingly, twin fetuses from such treatment, studied late in gestation, were symmetrically growth retarded. However, by 2 months of age offspring from the low-dose dexamethasone treatment were of normal growth, but had lower kidney weight (Moritz et al. 2002) . Although we demonstrated that male offspring, exposed to low-dose dexamethasone treatment early in gestation, were normotensive, at 2 months of age, the concern was raised that hypertension may develop later in these animals, due to possible kidney impairment.\n\n The results from this follow-up study suggest that prenatal low-dose dexamethasone treatment did not have any effect on blood pressure in both male and female offspring of sheep at 2 years of age. This is in contrast to the study in which high blood pressure was demonstrated for the first time in the 4-month-old sheep offspring exposed to high-dose dexamethasone between 26 and 28 days of gestation (Dodic et al. 1998) . The difference in blood pressure outcomes between these two studies is probably due to the considerably lower dose of dexamethasone used in the current study (12 times lower). In addition, in the former study, the effect of short prenatal dexamethasone exposure on blood pressure was shown in oophorectomised females and castrated males (Dodic et al. 1998 (Dodic et al. , 2002a . We have shown previously that in castrated males chronic testosterone replacement does not affect blood pressure (Dodic et al. 2002a) . In this study, we demonstrated that oophorectomy as well does not affect blood pressure in either control or dexamethasoneexposed groups of sheep. These results suggest that sex hormones do not play a significant role in maintenance of basal blood pressure in adult sheep nor modulate blood pressure changes induced by prenatal glucocorticoid exposure. In addition, in this particular cohort of animals blood pressure was not significantly different between males and females, as previously reported (Dodic et al. 2002a ). However, a trend towards higher blood pressure in males was observed when blood pressure measurements were performed at the comparable ages.\n\n The time of the dexamethasone treatment is an important period in renal development. In both human (weeks 5-12) and sheep (days 25-45) both meso-and metanephroi are present and at comparable stages of development (Moritz & Wintour 1999 ). Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that there is a critical period, which corresponds to a very early, preglomerular stage of metanephric development, during which excess glucocorticoid may affect both final nephron number and predispose to hypertension . Indeed, we have found recently that high-dose dexamethasone treatment, administered to pregnant ewes between 26 and 28 days of gestation, results in offspring with high blood pressure and fewer nephrons . Nephron counting was not performed in the current cohort, as they had normal blood pressure and renal function.\n\n In conclusion, these results are reassuring for those patients similarly exposed to prenatal dexamethasone treatment for CAH, as in our animal model no evidence of an altered renal function or predisposition to adult hypertension was found.\n\n This work was supported by a Block Grant form NH&MRC (983001) and a grant in aid from Broken Hill Proprieties (BHP; Australia).", "qa": [["17_12572543_4_1", "How does prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids in animal models affect cardiovascular and renal function in adulthood?\n", "Numerous studies in different animal species have shown that prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids can lead to altered cardiovascular and renal function in adulthood.

Steps to follow:\n\n \u25aa Take blood pressure, pulse, temperature and blood glucose, as they may have implications for the outcome of the labour.\n\n https: //dx.doi.org/10.15405/epsbs.2019.04.02.98 Corresponding Author: Amparo Garc\u00eda Salvador Selection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the conference eISSN: 798 \u25aa When the head is crowning, place the woman in a comfortable and intimate position and prepare for delivery. Encourage the expectant mother to push.\n\n \u25aa The expulsion of the foetal head should be allowed with a progressive distension of the vaginal introitus and the perineum avoiding a rapid and uncontrolled expulsion that produces perineal tears.\n\n \u25aa Delivery of the shoulders is facilitated by the release of the anterior shoulder, pulling in a downward direction from the foetal head, placing both hands around the head at the cervical and parietal level.\n\n \u25aa Then the posterior shoulder is released with the same manoeuvre, but in the opposite direction and protecting the perineum. The rest of the body comes out easily. Place the new born on the mother's abdomen (skin with skin) and record the time of birth.\n\n \u25aa Dry the baby well, put on a hat, cover it with dry cloths and with a thermal blanket to keep it warm as they can experience marked drops in body temperature which can lead to metabolic problems. The process of drying the baby stimulates it, making it cry and thus it begins to breathe. A normal Apgar test would be 7 to 10 points, in the first minute of life, if it is less than 7, the baby should be stimulated by vigorously drying the body and gently giving small blows to the soles of the feet.\n\n Once the heartbeat stops (in the cord), pinch it 5cm from the baby's body with the forceps to make it permanent, place a Kocher clamp about 2cm from the cord clip and cut the cord with sterile scissors between the two clamps. In 95% of deliveries the time interval between the birth of the newborn and the expulsion of the placenta is 15 to 30 min. Never pull the umbilical cord to remove the placenta (Protocolos Cl\u00ednico Terap\u00e9uticos en Urgencias Extrahospitalarias Instituto Nacional de Gesti\u00f3n Sanitaria, 2013).\n\n Precautions: Ensure that both the mother and the newborn are well, keeping them at a suitable temperature until their arrival at the nearest hospital. It is recommended that the new mother is accompanied at all times by a family member or person of trust and provide them with emotional support. Encourage breastfeeding (the suckling of the mother's nipple by the newborn produces a release of oxytocin in the mother).\n\n Monitor the constants, postpartum bleeding and uterine contraction every 15 minutes (for at least two hours).\n\n The objective of this bibliographic review was to collectively analyse women in a pregnant state or with birth imminent who arrive on pateras and to identify the possible nursing interventions with the aim of providing assistance and quality care until they can be transferred to a hospital.

Each of these findings is often a subtle change, and the endoscopist must be sure to clean off mucus adherent to the gastric wall, suction excessive gastric juice, supply sufficient air, and thoroughly observe the entire area within the stomach. Furthermore, when a lesion is observed, although a diagnosis of invasion depth is required, the endoscopist makes a comprehensive diagnostic judgment considering mural thickness and hardness, color, fold concentration, depression depth, and protrusion length. Reduction of air volume within the stomach is effective for observing wall thickness and hardness. The accuracy of conventional endoscopy to discriminate between intramucosal carcinoma and submucosal carcinoma is reported to be 72%-84% [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, although high-definition endoscopy was developed to improve image quality and diagnostic capability, it also allows for more accurate diagnosis of early gastric cancer than ultrathin endoscopy [20] .\n\n Chromoendoscopy. When subtle mucosal changes such as those described earlier are observed, detailed chromoendoscopic observation has been shown to effectively aid diagnosis. Typically, 0.1% indigo carmine is sprayed directly via the forceps channel. Early gastric cancer is diagnosed through comparison with the surrounding mucosa; so, the dye must also be sprayed widely over the mucosa surrounding the lesion. This method highlights subtle differences in elevation of the mucosal surface and changes in the surface structure and color and helps to improve qualitative diagnosis and diagnosis of the extent of invasion [21, 22] . Spraying of indigo carmine can, however, actually make the lesion boundaries unclear when mucus is adherent to the stomach wall; therefore, it is important to wash the lesion meticulously prior to spraying [23] . In addition, it should be noted that indigo carmine spraying can actually make it more difficult to observe the lesion if it exhibits few color changes or small differences in elevation.\n\n Band Imaging. NBI is a common type of equipment-based image-enhanced endoscopy that enhances the superficial surface structure and vascular architecture of the mucous layer by illuminating blue and green narrowband lights. Magnified endoscopy with NBI makes it possible to observe microvascular (MV) and microsurface (MS) patterns on the gastric mucosa in detail. Yao et al. combined changes in these patterns with the presence or absence of a demarcation line to establish a diagnostic system for gastric cancer called the VS classification system (Figure 3 ) [24] . This method has proven effective in actual clinical practice in two main areas. The first area is differential diagnosis of small gastric cancer and gastritis. With conventional endoscopic observation, it has been difficult to discriminate between small gastric cancer and benign abnormalities (e.g., gastritis) accurately in many cases. A prospective randomized controlled trial that investigated differential diagnosis of small depressed gastric cancer and gastritis with depressed lesions of less than 1 cm proved that the accuracy with combined NBI magnification surpassed that with conventional white light endoscopy [25] . The trial revealed that when NBI magnification was conducted after conventional observation with white light, the diagnostic capabilities were excellent, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity all above 95%. The use of this method accurately distinguishes between cancer and gastritis, thereby reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.\n\n The second area is the utility of including NBI magnification for margin determination when conducting the detailed examination prior to endoscopic therapy. While securing lateral margins based on accurate diagnosis is crucial during endoscopic therapy, it is difficult to determine the margins for early gastric cancer with both conventional endoscopy and chromoendoscopy in approximately 20% of cases [26, 27] .\n\n Macroscopically flat types of lesions, such as type 0-IIb, are common in such cases; yet, combined NBI magnification can still help to improve margin determination capabilities [26, 28] .\n\n Observation using NBI appears, therefore, to have clear advantages for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer if the necessary knowledge and skills are acquired. Endoscopists must be aware as NBI is not an all-purpose method. For example, because of the large size of the gastric lumen, use of nonmagnified NBI darkens the screen, limiting its use to the type of magnification outlined earlier. This means that it is not suitable for identifying lesions within the stomach. Furthermore, while it is very useful for margin determination with differentiated cancers, it has only limited utility with undifferentiated cancers.", "qa": [["75_8319035_1_1", "What are some important points to consider when conducting white light endoscopy?\n", "When conducting white light endoscopy, it is important to pay attention to points such as slight color changes in the mucosa (pale redness or fading of color), loss of visibility of underlying submucosal vessels, thinning of and interruptions in mucosal folds, and spontaneous bleeding.

Loss of CEACAM1 expression impairs negative modulation of Wnt signaling. Consequently, low CEACAM1 expression in breast cancer patients correlates with poorer outcome than high CEACAM1 expression. \n\n Dichotomous roles have been assigned to CEACAM1 in tumor development and progression: on the one hand, its expression has been correlated to increased tumor invasion in melanoma, lung carcinoma, in carcinomas of the thyroid, liver and colon; in these specimens, CEACAM1 is up-regulated during progression of the disease and has been established as an independent prognostic marker [57, 58] . On the other hand, in early stages, CEACAM1-L is down-regulated in tumor cells of different organs including neoplastic lesions of the colon, stomach, bladder and prostate [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Similarly, CEACAM1 is strongly expressed on normal breast epithelial cells and is downregulated in benign as well as malignant breast cancer [31, [66] [67] [68] [69] . As CEACAM1 can act as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth of several cancers, e.g. colon and prostate cancer, it was identified as a putative tumor suppressor [57, 58] . Based on our previous findings that overexpression of mutant p53 increases mammary carcinoma cell aggressiveness and is associated with an EMT gene expression signature and reduction of CEACAM1-expression, we analyzed the specific molecular role of CEACAM1 in EMT and cancer progression [11, 18] . In the present report, we demonstrate that CEACAM1 is a critical determinant in the regulation of the EMT switch. Taking advantage of the WAP-T mammary carcinoma mouse model and of the G-2 cancer stem cell line derived from it, we demonstrate for the first time that expression of CEACAM1-L can control the tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro by reducing EMT gene expression and invasion capabilities, and in vivo by decreasing its metastatic propensity. So far, only the CEACAM1-S isoform has been studied to greater detail with respect to mammary cell differentiation. However, the molecular basis for the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and CEACAM1-L has been determined in vitro, see below [38] .\n\n CEACAM1 is an integral component of adhesion junctions, where it co-localizes with E-cadherin, and \u03b2-catenin [70] . In culture systems, CEACAM1 is present null mice presents significant differences in metastastic frequencies. Data shown in percent \u00b1 standard error (B) Histological analyses of metastasis-free lung tissue and pulmonary metastases in WAP-T and WAP-T/CEACAM1 null mice reveal LT-expressing metastases in WAP-T/CEACAM1 null mice (upper panel, bold arrows point at clusters of intra-vascular and inter-septal metastases). These were identified in H&E stained tissue sections of tumorbearing WAP-T mouse (lower panels), whereas no metastases were found in the depicted tissue sections of a tumor-bearing WAP-T mouse; (C) Immune histological analyses of expression and localization of \u03b2-catenin and ZO-1 in mammary tumors from WAP-T and WAP-T/ CEACAM1 null mice reveal differential localization of \u03b2-catenin (red staining) at cell membranes (WAP-T mice, inset enlarged) and in the nuclei (WAP-T/CEACAM1 null mice; insets enlarged).

Government sponsorship for the district MHO was automatic and not clearly tied to efficiency and policy effectiveness or responsiveness criteria. All MHO that were not district-wide government-sponsored (public) were classified as private. Private MHO though recognized as not-for-profit solidarity organizations, and legally entitled to operate, would not receive any financial support from the national health insurance fund or any of the subsidies to cover groups exempt from premium payments such as the elderly and the poor.\n\n Financing of the NHIS was to be by individual premium payments and a 2.5% National Health Insurance Levy to be collected using the same mechanisms as the already existing 12.5% Value Added Tax (VAT). Two and a half per cent (2.5%) of formal sector worker contributions to the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) towards retirement benefits were to be automatically transferred to the national health insurance fund on a monthly basis.\n\n A National Health Insurance Council was to govern the NHIS. The object of the Council was 'to secure the implementation of a national health insurance policy that ensures access to basic health care services to all residents' (Republic of Ghana 2003). Its responsibilities included registration, licensing and regulation of health insurance schemes, and supervision of their operations. It was also responsible for granting accreditation to health care providers, monitoring their performance, and ensuring that health care services rendered to beneficiaries were of good quality. A chief executive officer and supporting secretariat were to support the National Health Insurance Council in the execution of its functions.\n\n The major disquiet expressed by organized labour groups over the bill was the channelling of 2.5% of their monthly SSNIT contributions into the national health insurance fund with no clear linked benefit to them. It appeared to be assumed that they could afford to give this money away. Parliament's response to these objections was to modify the bill so that as a benefit for giving up some of their social security funds, formal sector workers did not need to pay a premium to be covered by the district-wide MHO. Organized labour groups were still not happy with this arrangement. They felt the deductions would affect the long-term viability of the social security fund and pension payments. These concerns were part of longstanding concerns in the formal sector over low and inadequate pension payments and poor management of pension funds. They wanted to be allowed to organize social health insurance with separate payroll deductions that would leave their SSNIT contributions alone, and not lump them into district-wide MHO with the nonformal sector. Government's response was that the transfer of 2.5% of SSNIT pension payments into the national health insurance fund would not affect the viability of the SSNIT pension fund and the SSNIT funds were needed for crosssubsidization. There did not appear to be enough data to conclusively prove either government or organized labour groups right or wrong in their position on the viability of the SSNIT pension fund.\n\n Organized labour groups also expressed concerns about the functions of the National Health Insurance Council as being too wide and sweeping, and likely to end up creating an expensive and unwieldy bureaucracy that would not necessarily advance the cause of national health insurance in Ghana. They were also concerned about the implications of government subsidizing district MHO regardless of performance (TUC and JCF 2003) . In the widely publicized debates and commentaries, these other concerns were overshadowed by the more dramatic row over the 2.5% SSNIT deductions.\n\n The major expressed concern of the minority NDC was that the introduction of a 2.5% National Health Insurance Levy represented a rise in VAT from 12.5% to 15% and was an excessively high tax burden. The majority NPP insisted that the National Health Insurance Levy was not VAT despite the remarkable similarity. The Levy was a particularly contentious issue between the majority NPP and the minority NDC given the history of VAT in Ghana. The NDC introduced VAT during their second term of office as the majority (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) . At that time the NPP was the minority in parliament, and organized mass street protests against the introduction of VAT and the proposed rate as an excessive tax burden. The NDC had to back down on the original VAT bill and lower the proposed VAT rate to 10% before reintroducing it and getting it passed through parliament.

In the presence of hydroxyl radical, fibrinogen (the most hydrophobic protein in circulation) undergoes a drastic structural change, forming an insoluble fibrin-like precipitate. The quantity of precipitated fibrinogen is equivalent to the amount of the hydroxyl radical formed in the system [10] .\n\n Singlet oxygen is an excited state of molecular oxygen. It is less stable than the triplet oxygen. Its half-life (~10 -6 s) depends on the nature of the neighboring medium. It binds preferentially to the double bonds in the polyunsaturated fatty acids or in the guanine in DNA bases, forming endoperoxides that can be reduced to alkoxyl radicals that initiate radical chain reactions. Singlet oxygen is responsible for UV radiation skin damage, cataract formation, macular degeneration [2] . Peroxyl-and lipid peroxyl radicals have relatively long halflives, having time for diffusion in the biological systems. They are generated by the lipid peroxidation, which is started by the abstraction of an H atom from the polyunsaturated fatty acids, initialized by the hydroxyl radical [2, 12] .\n\n Lipids can be oxidized by the different reactive species through LO enzyme catalysis. It catalyzes the stereospecific insertion of molecular oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids to give rise to a complex family of biologically active lipids: carbon-centered lipid radical (L \u2022 ), lipid peroxyl radical (LOO \u2022 ), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) [3, 11] .\n\n Products of lipid peroxidation are peroxyl radical and organic hydroperoxide (LOOH or ROOH). They can reorganize to endoperoxide which are cleaved to yield aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), 2-propenal (acrolein) and isoprostanes as terminal products, which also cause tissue damage [8] . These aldehydes can react with amine groups of proteins modifying the structures of lipoproteins. They are also toxic and active mutagens [2, 11] .\n\n Nitric oxide is an enzymatically produced free radical being synthesized by a variety of NOS with role in the regulation of vascular tone, neurotransmission, and immunity [4] . It is formed enzymatically from L-arginine (Figure 4 ). eNOS and iNOS isoforms are two different variant expressed by adipocytes. In the lack of sufficient amounts of substrates they can also produce O 2\n\n \u2022- [6] . Aging can decreased eNOS availability and reduce NO synthesis causing endothelial dysfunction and impaired ventricular contractility in elderly patients [13] .\n\n Physiological effects of NO are the relaxation of smooth muscles in blood-vessel and macrophages activation having role in triggering the primary immune protection. An excess of NO is cytotoxic.", "qa": [["22_77758857_1_1", "How do reactive oxygen species, specifically the hydroxyl radical, contribute to cellular damage and oxidative stress?\n", "The hydroxyl radical, known as the most reactive species, is formed from water through high-energy irradiation or from hydrogen peroxide in the metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction. This highly reactive species has a significant negative effect on cells, particularly through involvement in lipid peroxidation, initiating chain reactions and forming lipid hydroperoxide and other free radicals.

Studies investigating the effects of cerebral ischaemia (such as during carotid endarterectomy) on BIS have been contradictory with some demonstrating a correlation with ischaemia whilst others shown one 4, 5 . This apparent inconsistency is at least partially explained by distal collateral circulation being able to compensate for some causes of more proximal cerebral ischaemia. Subtle ischaemia is also unlikely to be picked up using a unilateral BIS montage. The advent of a bilateral BIS sensor for general anaesthesia 6 may shed more light on these discrepancies and allow more subtle changes to be detected since they could potentially result in left to right hemispheric BIS differences.\n\n Not all balloon assisted neuro-radiological procedures will result in potential ischaemia, however those involving vascular territories with poor collateral circulation might benefit from the use of BIS (ideally in a bilateral array) as a tool to detect early and potentially avoidable adverse neurological events.\n\n Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the patient.\n\n Author contributions JA and ZH conceived the idea.

Upon balloon deflation, BIS seemed to return more rapidly to its pre-inflation value. The red right hand scale in Figure 2 shows that there was no EMG interference that could have contributed to these changes, nor had there been any coincidental haemodynamic variation. No muscle relaxants or drugs other than those outlined above, had been administered. The anaesthetic team alerted the neuro-radiologists to these changes. They were able to limit the duration of subsequent balloon inflations resulting in demonstrably shorter subsequent BIS falls as seen in Figure 2. Post procedure, the patient was woken up and on return to the ward had a GCS of 15 with no neurological deficit. He was discharged home after 48 hours and has recovered well at home with no problems.\n\n This case illustrates a sudden, reversible and repeated decrease in intraoperative Bispectral Index (BIS) values during a balloon coiling of an intracerebral aneurysm. One possible explanation is that the monitor detected repeated periods of cerebral hypoperfusion. An abrupt decrease in BIS values not associated with changes in anaesthetic technique or haemodynamics may alert the anaesthetist to such an event. In this case there was no change in blood pressure, there had been no drugs administered such as muscle relaxants and there was no recorded EMG interference. Early communication with the surgeon or interventionist in such cases could potentially avoid procedure related neurological injury.\n\n There have been previous case reports of sudden decreases in BIS value during other neurosurgical and neuro-radiological interventions. These include rupture of cerebral aneurysms during coiling 1 , embolization of arterio-venous malformations 2 and intraventricular haemorrhage during third ventriculoscopy 3 . Rapid increases in intracranial pressure and vasospasm have been postulated as possible causes for the decrease in BIS values.\n\n The aneurysm in this case was on the ICA at the termination of the vessel. The angiographic balloon was placed via the ICA into the proximal MCA. Balloon inflation with simultaneous occlusion of the distal ICA and proximal middle cerebral arteries is more hazardous than the same procedure confined to the ICA as complete occlusion of the carotid tip prevents collateral flow from the contralateral circulation to the MCA (via the circle of Willis). Repeated balloon inflation within a vessel may lead to platelet aggregation or vessel wall injury with subsequent neurological injury. However, in this case the repeated acute change in the BIS values with rapid In this patient, the BIS sensor was positioned to primarily monitor the cerebral hemisphere undergoing intervention.\n\n Studies investigating the effects of cerebral ischaemia (such as during carotid endarterectomy) on BIS have been contradictory with some demonstrating a correlation with ischaemia whilst others show none .

The American Academy of Pain Medicine defined crucial assumptions for a successful screening trial, namely: 50% or more pain relief persisting despite provocative physical therapy, stable or decreased analgesic dosage, patient satisfaction with the SCS results, and patient ability to maintain the technical aspect of the device [35] . The British Pain Society still believes that more high-quality RCTs are needed for SCS as a reliable method of treatment. Nonetheless, the society supports SCS therapy under the condition of appropriately and carefully selected patients by thoroughly prepared multidisciplinary teams. The society published recommendations for best clinical practice and the context of SCS usage; these emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to properly assess patients [34] . SCS therapy in carefully selected FBSS patients presenting mainly radicular pain, declaring a reasonable level of expectations and the need for compliance, combined with a strict cooperation with a multidisciplinary team of specialists, is likely to be the new standard of good clinical practice.\n\n Electrotherapy has its beginning in 1965 when Melzack and Wall [36] proposed the gate control theory. The theory posited that nerves carrying pain stimuli and vibration and touch sensations both terminate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of large myelinated A-fibres can suppress the transmission of pain stimulus through the spinal integrative center (the gate) [37, 38] .\n\n In 1989 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved SCS to treat pain from nerve damage in the trunk, arms, or legs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with FBSS, which was defined as pain continuing or resuming despite an operative procedure undertaken to correct the cause of the pain.\n\n A proposed mechanism of pain signal inhibition by SCS stimuli is shown in Fig. 2 . A typical SCS device consists of four components: a pulse generator, a lead that connects the electrode(s) contacts to the electrical pulse generator, an extension cable that connects the lead(s) to the pulse generator, and a remote controller to turn the stimulator on or off and to adjust the level of stimulation. SCS implantation usually consists of two phases. Patient selected for SCS implantation should have a stimulation trial, using externalized leads to mimic the effects of a true neurostimulator. If the stimulation trial is successful, permanent surgical implantation of a spinal stimulator is performed.\n\n Most studies have reported generally minor adverse effects, except for a few cases of epidural abscess, thrombosis, meningism, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, and hemorrhage. The most common reported complication was lead migration (15%-28% when traditional SCS was used and 2%-2.5% when new SCS techniques were used), followed by local wound infection, pocket pain, loss of therapeutic effect, or CSF leak with headache [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] \n\n Clinical studies have shown improvement of 50% to 70% concerning decreased dosages of analgesics, decreased pain intensity scores, and functional amelioration [44] . Although SCS declines in effectiveness over time due to the growing central nervous system tolerance in 20% to 40% of patients, still advantages outrank reoperation [45] . Literature reviews have documented an increasing treatment efficacy in FBSS with time, with pain reduced by over 50% and medical usage reduced by 41% to 84% in the majority of patients [45] [46] [47] . The RCT performed by North et al. [48] and the PRO-CESS trial by Kumar et al. [49] bolstered the high efficacy of SCS in FBSS treatment. North et al. [48] compared SCS patients to those who underwent a reoperation of lumbosacral spine. PROCESS compared SCS plus conventional medical management (CMM) to CMM alone. CMM consisted of oral medications, nerve blocks, epidural corticosteroids, and physical and psychological therapy [49] . North et al. [48] documented significant pain relief in 39% of the patients from the SCS group vs. 12% in the reoperation group, and confirmed an 87% decrease in analgesic use (SCS) to only 58% in reoperation group. At 6-months follow-up, the majority of patients (67%) from the reoperation group desired to crossover to SCS therapy.", "qa": [["24_18253600_1_1", "What is the gate control theory and how does it relate to electrotherapy?\n", "The gate control theory, proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965, suggests that activation of large myelinated A-fibers can suppress the transmission of pain stimuli through the spinal integrative center (the gate).

TF is the principal surface receptor and cofactor for the activated coagulation protease factor VIIa and is a receptor for its zymogen precursor. The extrinsic coagulation cascade is triggered by the binding of factor VIIa to TF, which creates a complex for the activation of the protease factor X and its conversion to factor Xa. Generation of factor Xa and the TF-factor VIIa complex triggers the proteolytic conversion of factor II (prothrombin) to thrombin.\n\n TF is expressed constitutively on the adventitia of uninjured blood vessels and other extravascular tissues [57] . Upregulation of TF gene expression occurs in malignant cells and in normal host cells that respond to inflammatory or remodeling signals, which might arise from ECs, MAs, and fibroblasts [58] . Therefore, cytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and EGF [58] , produced by inflammatory and malignant cells might induce the expression of TF in fibroblasts and ECs. Experimental evidence has also shown that expression of TF by ECs can be under the control of VEGF, which can be mediated by the VEGF receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase (flt-1) and flt-1/ kinase insert domain-containing receptor [59] . Two downstream components of the coagulation cascade, thrombin [60] and fibrin [61] , can also regulate TF expression by ECs. Both downregulation and inhibition of TF expression can modulate tumor cell procoagulant activity. Recent evidence suggests that TF expression might alter the cancer cell phenotype and possibly contribute to angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . Aberrant TF expression has been detected in various human tumors, including EOC [62] [63] [64] , breast cancer [65] , nonsmall cell lung cancer [66] , colon cancer [67] , and pancreatic cancer [68] but is not usually found in normal tissues from these sites. Elevated expression of TF in tumors has been associated with certain unfavorable prognostic indicators, such as angiogenesis, metastasis, advanced disease stage, and multidrug resistance [69] .\n\n The formation of new cellular masses at an organ site creates an obvious extra demand for oxygen, growth factors, and metabolites and increases the need for tumor-associated blood vessels. The stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis that can regulate new vessel formation include VEGF, acidic and basic FGF, hepatocyte growth factor, and TGF. Angiostatin, endostatin, and antiangiogenic antithrombin might function as inhibitors of angiogenesis [70] .\n\n Angiogenesis can be mediated by either coagulationdependent or-independent activation pathways [71] . Coagulation-dependent pathways always involve activation of the TF receptor to its ligand, followed by production of thrombin and ensuing clot formation. Coagulation-independent pathways appear to involve phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the TF receptor and subsequent downstream signaling events that occur independently of thrombin production or clot formation. Both pathways can contribute to angiogenesis and tumor progression. Increased expression of TF in tumors may contribute to angiogenesis in part by increasing VEGF protein expression and downregulating the expression of the antiangiogenic protein thrombospondin [11] . For example, TF-positive colorectal tumors have higher levels of microvessel density and VEGF expression than TF-negative colorectal tumors do [67] . Colocalization of TF and VEGF mRNA and protein has been demonstrated in breast cancer, malignant glioma, and adenocarcinoma of the lung [72] . In the coagulationdependent pathway, the interaction of TF and factor VIIa induces Ca 2+ oscillations and changes in gene expression, and the formation of the TF-factor VIIa complex leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [73] , which is a major inducer of VEGF expression. The catalytic activity of the TF-factor VIIa complex contributes to the activation of factor X to factor Xa and subsequently to thrombin.
