It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Also, people with an opportunistic infection were more likely to have a non-communicable disease as well (OR = 3.33). This association has been identified by other studies as well according to a systematic review by Haregu T et al in 2012 who attributed it to NCDs complicating adherence to HIV treatment and also weakening patients' immune systems hence increasing likelihood of opportunistic infections. Overall NCDs are prevalent among PLHIV, and strategies to encourage early diagnosis and treatment should be intensified.\n\n The study was conducted at an urban HIV specialized care centre that attends to needs of over 15,000 people living with HIV in Uganda. This is a large proportion of PLHIV in Uganda hence study findings are generalizable to all other PLHIV receiving care at an urban centre in the country.\n\n Extraction of patient's disease status/ patient information was done by qualified registered nurses currently working at JCRC that are familiar with HIV related research studies and have knowledge regarding non-communicable diseases. This greatly improved the quality of the data collected.\n\n Routine care patient files were used as the primary data source for this study; this shows routinely collected data can be used to make significant findings that are valuable especially in resource limited settings such as Uganda. No other studies in Uganda have looked at co-morbidity in relation to HIV while assessing several diseases yet a patient experiencing multi-morbidity has to live with several illnesses at the same time, not independently as how other studies only investigating a co-morbidity may imply. It gives a clearer image from the perspective of the patient.\n\n This study highlights the need to not only focus on HIV but other chronic illnesses as well.\n\n The study was conducted at only one site located in an urban area therefore the study findings may not be generalizable to people receiving HIV care from other sites that are rural or not specialized HIV care sites, or are government facilities. In addition, patients at JCRC receive their medication on average every 3 months thus sampling from patients who attended the facility from March-April did not include some patients. However, there is no known distinction between the patients that come in the different months, so should not significantly affect the findings.\n\n This study was carried out at the out -patient clinic where patients received free antiretroviral therapy, thus inpatients and private patients were not included in the study. However, it is expected that most inpatients may have a higher prevalence of co morbidities. More so patients with known co-morbidities may have been referred to other specialized care facilities.\n\n The study population also had no individuals with HIV stage IV, so study findings are not entirely generalizable to all individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\n This study also had the limitation of using patient files to determine if an individual has an NCD or not. As much as this gives an estimate of the prevalence of NCDs, the actual NCD burden is higher than what this study estimates. Thus the results need to be interpreted with that in consideration.\n\n Non-communicable diseases are a growing concern not only due to their health implications, but also their impact on socio economic status. This study found that 1 in every 5 people living with HIV, has an NCD. There is need to encourage early diagnosis and treatment of non-communicable diseases among PLHIV in Uganda.

A majority of the positive associations have been in individuals with lower folate levels. Lowering levels of homocysteine with vitamin supplementation has not been shown to affect cancer incidence in one trial.\n\n Elevated plasma homocysteine and abnormalities in methylation have been studied in relation to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disease. Methionine conversion to Sadenosylmethionine (SAMe), a universal methyl donor, is important for neurotransmitter, DNA, RNA, protein, and hormone methylation. The relationship between abnormal methylation and neurodevelopment has lead to research related to the association of MTHFR polymorphisms and neuropsychiatric disease.\n\n Overall, data regarding MTHFR polymorphisms, elevated homocysteine, and risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions have been inconclusive. One meta-analysis showed a modest increased risk for bipolar disorder [OR 1.82 (1.22-2.70)], unipolar depression [OR 1.36 (1.11-1.67)], and schizophrenia [OR 1.44 (1.21-1.70]); there was no significant association with anxiety (Gilbody et al. 2007 ). However, later case-control studies did not show an association of MTHFR genotype and depression (Gaysina et al. 2008) . A recent updated meta-analysis regarding risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed that most significant risk was for C677T homozygosity and schizophrenia [OR 1.34 (1.18-1.53)]. There was a slightly increased chance for bipolar disorder in C677T homozygotes [OR 1.26 (1.00-1.59)]. In subgroup analyses, the association was significant in Asian and African populations but not in white populations. The A1298C variant was significantly associated with schizophrenia in Asian populations, but there was not an association with bipolar disorder (Hu et al. 2014) . A meta-analysis of eight case-control studies demonstrated a significant association between C677T polymorphism and autism spectrum disorder [TT vs. CC: OR 1.86 (1.08-3.20)] (Pu et al. 2013 ). However, when stratified by region with folate supplementation in the food supply, results were only significant for countries without food fortification.\n\n Summary: There are inconclusive data regarding MTHFR variants, hyperhomocysteinemia, and risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Subgroup analyses have shown more positive associations in populations without dietary folate supplementation.\n\n An important qualification for interpreting the impact of MTHFR polymorphisms, homocysteine, and disease risk in the United States is the fortification of grain products with folic acid, which was implemented in January 1998. Folic acid, a synthetic form of folate, has been shown to decrease the risk of NTDs (MRC Vitamin Study Research Group 1991). Implementation of mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of NTDs population-wide (Williams et al. 2015) . Given the role of folate as a co-factor in the re-methylation pathway, it has been proposed that folic acid fortification may also mask the effect of MTHFR-related hyperhomocysteinemia in the United States. Cohort analyses have demonstrated that the impact of a genetic risk factor for hyperhomocysteinemia (i.e. MTHFR C677T genotype) was substantially reduced in the folic acid-fortified compared to non-fortified population (Nagele et al. 2011) . Two studies comparing homocysteine levels in individuals homozygous for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism versus individuals with MTHFR homozygous wild-type genotype showed a significant reduction in the difference in homocysteine levels after folic acid fortification (Tsai et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2008) . Further, the prevalence of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia significantly decreased in MTHFR C677T homozygotes following fortification (Tsai et al. 2009 ).\n\n Yet, some studies have raised concern for the potential health effects of unmetabolized folic acid (Morris et al. 2007; Troen et al. 2006) .

Effective and fast blood coagulation was observed (Dobrynin et al., 2011) . The authors concluded that plasma treatment is safe for living intact and wounded skin in plasma doses several times higher than required for inactivation of bacteria. Human skin physiology parameters were influenced by plasma, however, without damaging the skin or skin functions, indicating the safety of plasma under in vivo conditions (Fluhr et al., 2012) . First clinical studies confirmed that plasma treatment was well tolerated, painless and without side effects (Isbary et al., 2010 (Isbary et al., , 2012 Daeschlein et al., 2012b; Emmert et al., 2013; Brehmer et al., 2014) .

Non-thermal atmosphericpressure plasma is a new innovative approach not only for the treatment of chronic wounds, but with a wide-range of other applications, as e.g. topical treatment of other skin diseases with microbial involvement or treatment of cancer diseases.

All SAH segments used for experiments showed angiographic vasospasm.\n\n We first needed to ensure that the cell isolation procedure used below for single-cell electrophysiology did not damage the smooth muscle cells and, specifically, preferentially damage the SAH cells. This was performed in several ways. First, to confirm that smooth muscle cells in vasospastic SAH arteries were depolarized as reported previously (Harder et al, 1987) , intracellular microelectrode recordings were made of smooth muscle membrane potential in intact, pressurized dog basilar arteries from control dogs and dogs 7 days after SAH. The side branches of short segments of basilar arteries were carefully tied with threads of silk under an operating microscope. The endothelium was preserved. The vessels were mounted on glass pipettes and tied with sutures and pressurized to the pressure that would be expected in the basilar artery in vivo (80 mm Hg). Glass microelectrodes were pulled on a Sutter P-97 programmable puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) and filled with KCl, 2 mol/L. Tip resistances were 20 to 50 MO and tip potentials o5 mV. Intracellular penetration was obtained under a microscope by advancing the glass electrode into the surface of the vessel with the aid of a hydraulic micromanipulator (MW-3, Narishige International USA, East Meadow, NY, USA). Membrane potentials were recorded on an Axopatch-1D preamplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Signals were filtered with a 2 kHz low-pass filter, digitized at 12 bits using a DigiData 1200 interface controlled by pClamp 6.0.4. The current-clamp mode with zero input was used to monitor membrane voltage. The criteria for a successful impalement include a sharp decrease in voltage from baseline on entry of the microelectrode into a cell, stable membrane potential for at least 2 mins, no change in tip resistance, and return to zero potential on removal of the electrode (Knot and Nelson, 1998) . These measurements were made at room temperature (221C to 241C) and body temperature (371C). Bath and intraluminal solutions were Krebs-Henseleit solution containing (in mmol/L): NaCl 113.7, KCl 4.7, NaHCO 3 25, MgSO 4 1.2, KH 2 PO 4 1.2, glucose 10, and CaCl 2 2.5 bubbled with a mixture of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 (Jiang et al, 2001) .\n\n The presence of functional K IR channels in large cerebral arteries from dogs and whether they were altered after SAH could be determined best by electrophysiological recordings from isolated smooth muscle cells. To that end, basilar artery smooth muscle cells were isolated by cutting the artery into small pieces and incubating the pieces for 30 mins in enzymes (500 U/mL collagenase type IV, 50 U/mL elastase, 100 U/mL DNase I, and 1 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) (Subramanian et al, 1991) .

Migraine chronification may result from maladaptive neuroplasticity along the nociceptive pathway [2] . Repeated trigeminal activation at the meningeal neurovascular endings indeed, with the associated neurogenic inflammation, may induce peripheral and central sensitization, which in turn predisposes patients to develop more migraine attacks in a vicious cycle that, in some migraineurs, leads to chronic migraine [3] . The mechanisms involved in migraine chronification are largely elusive; however, a major role seems to be played by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a vasodilatory peptide released by trigeminovascular endings to cause vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and peripheral sensitization [4] . The role of CGRP in migraine attacks is reinforced by the efficacy of CGRP antagonism in animal models of migraine pain [5] [6] [7] and by promising reports on the efficacy of CGRP-related drugs in clinical trials, e.g. telcagepant or LY2951742 [8] [9] [10] . Recently, monoclonal antibodies directed against CGRP have proved effective in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine [11] . The precise mechanisms and sites where CGRP may act to favor chronification of migraine are still to be identified. CGRP receptors are largely distributed also in the brain, providing a wide range of possible CGRP targets and sites of interactions with other systems [12] . Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug with established efficacy in chronic migraine prevention [13, 14] . The drug likely acts on the cell excitatory mechanisms via its influence on the receptor/channel protein complexes [15] [16] [17] .\n\n Nitroglycerin (NTG) is a nitric oxide (NO) donor that has been used for years as a provocative test in migraine for diagnostic and research purposes [18, 19] . In rodents, NTG induces an increased sensitivity to pain stimuli [20] [21] [22] and its chronic and intermittent administration causes acute plantar mechanical hyperalgesia with a progressive and sustained hyperalgesia [23, 24] . This behavior nicely reflects the increased sensitivity to painful stimuli in migraineurs [25] and therefore may be relevant for understanding the mechanism underlying migraine. Here, we aimed at gathering more insights into the role and mechanisms of CGRP in migraine chronification by chronic migraine-like rat model that mimics the condition of chronic migraine. In this model we evaluated: a) CGRP and c-Fos gene expression in areas involved in trigeminal nociception; b) the nociceptive threshold at the tail flick; c) orofacial mechanical allodynia; d) the modulatory effect of the migraine preventive drug topiramate.\n\n \n\n We used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 200-250 g, Charles River, s.r.l, Calco, Lecco, Italy) at the Centralized Animal Facility of the University of Pavia.

In South Korea, 506 and 82 out of 588 V. vulnificus infection cases were men (86.1%) and women (13.9%), respectively, from 2001 to 2010 [13] . In a study in Taiwan, the rates of V. vulnificus infection were also higher in men than women [4] . The reason behind this difference in susceptibility is unclear. A study involving rats showed that after the administration of V. vulnificus lipopolysaccharide extracts, the 24-hour mortality rate was 82% in male rats and 21% in female rats. However, the mortality rate of female rats without ovaries increased to nearly 75%; The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 33, No. 6, November 2018 subsequent estrogen administration reduced the mortality rate to 38%. This demonstrates that estrogen has protective effects against V. vulnificus sepsis [15] .\n\n V. vulnificus causes three distinct syndromes: gastrointestinal tract limited infections, wound infections, and primary septicemia [5, 16] . Septicemia is one of the most common clinical problems. It is often accompanied by skin and soft tissue infections and has a > 50% mortality rate [16] [17] [18] . Atypical manifestations of V. vulnificus infection include pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, peritonitis, and pyogenic spondylitis [9, 19, 20] . Watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills without skin and soft tissue lesions are the symptoms associated with gastrointestinal tract limited infections caused by V. vulnificus, which may occur in immunocompetent individuals; however, death due to gastrointestinal tract limited infections is rare [5] . Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are often preceded by primary septicemia with skin and soft tissue infections [2, 21] . Therefore, distinguishing between simple gastrointestinal symptoms and premonitory symptoms that can worsen to septicemia is important, especially in individuals at high risk for V. vulnificus infection [22] .\n\n Patients with primary septicemia caused by V. vulnificus infection require hospitalization and are typically in septic shock upon admission to the emergency room. Primary septicemia is a bacteremia that usually has no definite route of infection, with the portal of entry presumably either at the small intestine or the proximal colon [16, 23] . It typically begins with an abrupt fever, chills, and gastrointestinal symptoms; metastatic infection appears as skin lesions that usually occur in the lower extremities with bullae, ecchymosis, or Wound infections differ from primary septicemia because of its portal of entry in the skin; V. vulnificus enters through existing wounds or through areas of traumatic damage. The extent of wound infection with V. vulnificus varies from mild to severe. Wound infection can occur in immunocompetent individuals, such as those with simple gastroenteritis. However, in severe cases, more than half of patients suffer from severe cellulitis accompanied by bullae or ecchymosis within 24 hours of symptom onset. Skin lesions can worsen to necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene. In contrast to primary septicemia, skin lesions are limited to the areas where V. vulnificus is inoculated, and metastatic infections usually do not occur [2, 5, 16, 24] .\n\n In a study on V. vulnificus infections in Florida from 1981 to 1987, 38 out of 62 patients had primary septicemia, 17 had wound infections, and seven had gastrointestinal illness without septicemia or wound infections [22] . A study of V. vulnificus infections in Taiwan investigated clinical and epidemiologic features from 1995 to 2000; among the 84 total patients, 20 had primary septicemia and 57 had wound infections. A similar previous study in Taiwan found that no patients had gastrointestinal illness [4, 17] .

The significant increase in lipolysis observed with both doses of dopamine ( fig. 2) showed that the catecholamine was a potent stimulator of the adrenoreceptors in the adipose tissue. Fain (1973) has demonstrated that lipolysis is subserved by Pj-adrenoreceptors in all animal species, so that we would predict similar changes in man. Random estimations of plasma FFA values in the dogs confirmed the increase in lipolysis, and when dopamine 30 jxg kg-1 min\" 1 was infused individual values greater than 2 mmol litre\" 1 were found. It is possible that high FFA values predispose to cardiac arrhythmias (Oliver, 1972) , although this is disputed by most cardiologists (Opie, 1972) . It is usually considered that the infusion of dopamine has little effect on heart rate or myocardial irritability, but recent studies by Chauve, Castro and Fontan (1977) and Miller (1977) have reported the occurrence of tachyarrhythmias. Although it has been assumed that this represents a direct effect of dopamine on the myocardium, a secondary effect from the stimulation of lipolysis may be contributory.\n\n The cause of the statistically significant, but metabolically small, increase in lactate concentration observed with the administration of dopamine 10 (xg kg -1 min\" 1 ( fig. 3) is obscure, particularly as oxygen availability increased more than oxygen consumption (Scott, Chakrabarti and Hall, 1979) . However, the failure of the larger dose of dopamine to increase blood lactate concentration significantly showed that there was unlikely to be an important contribution from the stimulation of p 2 -adrenoreceptors responsible for lactate production in muscle (Brody and McNeill, 1970) . Dopamine had little effect on plasma potassium concentration ( fig. 4) , but if the associated haemoconcentration was a result of a diuresis (Scott, Chakrabarti and Hall, 1979) this may prevent the full extent of the hypokalaemic response from being recorded.\n\n We conclude that the administration of dopamine i.v. is associated with significant changes in glucose and fat metabolism.

EGFR is overexpressed in most epithelial malignancies including HNSCC, ranging from 31 to 100% [32] . We showed EGFR expression in 20 out of 24 cases (83.3%) of squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsils. The results of the different immunohistochemical studies were however not consistent. These differences could be explained by the use of different antibodies, immunohistochemical techniques and scoring systems. Variations in EGFR immunoreactivity are also dependent on the fixation procedure and the storage time of unstained tissue sections [35] .\n\n In the search for which patients will benefit from anti-EGFR therapy, multiple studies investigating EGFR gene amplification have been performed. Increased EGFR gene copy number has been linked to poor prognosis in NSCLC [10] and HNSCC [11, 12] .\n\n In our study, like Alvarez et al. [22] and Walker et al. [24] , no EGFR gene amplification could be identified in anal canal squamous cell carcinoma samples. The prevalence of increased EGFR gene copy number in HNSCC varies in different studies, ranging between 13-58% [11, 12, 36] . In the present study, four tonsil squamous cell carcinomas showed EGFR gene amplification, defined as a ratio of EGFR gene copies to CEP7 gene copies of at least two in more than 10% of tumour cells. We found EGFR protein expression was independent of EGFR gene amplification. Although EGFR gene amplification was identified in only four cases of tonsil squamous cell carcinoma, it was not possible to correlate this finding with patient outcome.\n\n Approximately 85% of NSCLC patients who responded favourably to gefitinib or erlotinib were shown to have somatic mutations in the EGFR gene [7] [8] [9] [10] . About 90% of EGFR mutations affect small regions of the gene usually within exons 18 to 21, which encode for the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. Anti-EGFR treatment can prevent activation of downstream signalling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt, RAS/Erk and STAT pathways, resulting in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis.\n\n No prior study has investigated EGFR gene mutation status in squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. In our panel, exons 18 to 21, encoding the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain were investigated. No mutations in the EGFR gene were identified which excludes overexpression being the result of the presence of mutations.\n\n Up to date there have been few studies searching for mutations in HNSCC and the results are contradictory. Lee et al. [27] found the mutation E746_A750del in 3 out of 41 Asian HNSCC patients (7.3%) and Na et al. [28] described several changes in 17 out of 108 Korean HNSCC patients (15.7%). Recently, one report analysed 91 Japanese HNSCC and 12 HNSCC cell lines for mutations in EGFR, ErbB2 and K-RAS. Only one silent mutation, C836T was found in exon 21 of EGFR in the UT-SCC-16A cell line. No other mutations were found [29] . Chung et al. [11] reported that no EGFR-activating mutations were found in 86 tumour samples from 82 American HNSCC patients. Temam et al. [12] also failed to detect any EGFR mutation in 134 French and American HNSCC patients. Lemos-Gonzalez et al. [30] analysed EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations from 31 Spanish HNSCC patients and none displayed a somatic EGFR mutation. Loeffler-Ragg et al. [31] screened 100 Caucasian HNSCC patients and only one displayed a novel, somatic EGFR missense mutation. From the same group Schwentner et al. [32] reported a rare EGFR mutation p. G796S in 2 out of 127 Austrian patients.\n\n In our study, no EGFR mutations were found in tonsil squamous cell carcinoma, which confirms that EGFR kinase mutations are rare in Caucasian patients.

Before each measurement, the instrument was calibrated by the placement of a hollow cylinder with known mass and volume into the Bod Pod. Participants wore a Lycra or silicone swim cap and tight-fitting, Spandex-like shorts and (sport bra for women) to reduce the effects of isothermal air. The participant was first sealed in the Bod Pod capsule. Body volume was measured by the body's air displacement with corrections for residual lung volume and surface area artifacts (8) . Thoracic gas volume was measured in each individual while the participant breathed through a tube connected to a filter and reference chamber, following the manufacturer's instructions. After a few normal breaths, the participant was signaled by the operator to exhale with 3 small, consecutive huffs. The surface area artifact was automatically calculated by the Bod Pod software. These 2 adjustments (thoracic gas volume and surface area artifact) were factored into the overall calculation of body volume. Volumetric density was that actual measurement displayed by the Bod Pod; TBV was calculated as the scale weight divided by this density value.\n\n Participants were scanned on a Discovery Wi DXA system (Hologic Inc) while dressed in a hospital gown or the attire used for the ADP measures. Participants lay flat on the DXA table and the whole-body scan took ;7 min. The Hologic software version for analysis was Discovery 12.6; measures reported included the following used in this study: total body mass, percentage fat, and BMC. Hologic's NHANES population option was used in the analysis for the percentage fat measurement. This option is intended to improve the agreement of the DXA soft tissue measures with those of the 4C models (9) . The NHANES option multiplies the lean mass by 0.946 and the fat mass by 1.05. In addition, all DXA images were analyzed with the use of custom software that we developed to quantify TBV and mass, as further described below. The pixel size of the DXA images was 0.80 cm 2 .\n\n In commercial DXA systems, X-ray attenuation values are used to solve directly for the mass of fat and lean soft tissue. Calibration phantoms of biologically equivalent materials with known composition are scanned on each DXA machine to create the relation between DXA attenuation values and the masses of fat and lean tissue. With a known pixel size, fat mass and lean mass can be represented as thickness or volume. Instead of solving for fat mass and lean mass, our approach was to use a similar calibration process to solve for volume and mass with the use of the following general steps: A soft tissue calibration phantom was created to relate pixel mass and volume to DXA attenuation values of various thicknesses and compositions. Materials that mimic the X-ray properties of biological materials were used such that regions could be defined with specific compositions of lipid, protein, and water. Lipid was represented as machinable wax (McMaster Carr Inc), water as Plastic Water LR (CIRS Inc) (10) , and protein as the thermoplastic material Delrin (11) . Delrin has been shown previously to represent protein's X-ray properties well (11) . The distributions of protein, lipid, and water values were chosen to fall within typical biological concentration ranges (12) . Delrin sheets (which represented protein) were placed beneath blocks of machinable wax (lipid) and solid water (water) to create unique 2 3 4 cm 2 -sized regions of interests.

Can these changes in Na \u03e9 current cause myocardial damage? Previously, Grant et al 22 reported that \u232cK1500 shifted inactivation to a more negative voltage range and induced a large increase in late Na \u03e9 current. The mutation was associated with long-QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and conduction system disease. Microscopically, \u232cK1500 also changed channel activation by inducing a positive shift with a reduced slope factor. A1180V, however, did not affect channel activation. R1193Q, a variant proximate to A1180V, was also observed to cause a negative shift in inactivation with an accelerated current inactivation and an increase in late Na \u03e9 current. 23 This profile is similar to but not exactly the same as the A1180V phenotype. However, R1193Q is a common variant present in \u03f712% of Chinese. 20 In our study, heterozygous R1193Q was present in 2 noncarriers, 2 unaffected carriers, and 1 affected carrier (Data Supplement Table II) . Thus, the pathogenic significance of the phenotype of this variant is unclear.\n\n Remarkably, we found a better match of the phenotype of A1180V outside of the SCN5A mutations. In rabbit and mouse cardiomyocytes, Wagner et al 24 found that phosphorylation of cardiac Na \u03e9 channels by direct association of the channels with Ca 2\u03e9 /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u2426 C (CaMKII\u2426 C ) induced a negative shift of steadystate inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation, and enhanced late Na \u03e9 current. CaMKII\u2426 C does not affect channel activation and current density and neither does A1180V. The biophysical profile of cardiac Na \u03e9 channels under the modulation of CaMKII\u2426 C qualitatively overlaps with the phenotypic profile of A1180V in all aspects, although quantitatively the effect of CaMKII\u2426 C is more prominent. Transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKII\u2426 C developed DCM and heart failure, 25 and their cardiomyocytes had an abnormally high concentration of cellular Na \u03e9 . 24 Because A1180V and CaMKII\u2426 C share a similar profile in their effect on cardiac Na \u03e9 channels, we postulate that cellular Na \u03e9 concentration and, as a consequence, intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 and pH are altered in a heart that expresses A1180V channels. Unfortunately, because CaMKII\u2426 C also mediates phosphorylation of Ca 2\u03e9 regulatory proteins, 25 at present, it is difficult to determine the role of abnormal Na \u03e9 concentration through Na \u03e9 channels in the pathogenesis of DCM on the basis of data obtained from CaMKII\u2426 C -transgenic mice.\n\n It needs to be noted that recent studies have shown that the splicing variant Q1077del altered the channel phenotype in some SCN5A mutants and common variants. 26 In our functional study, only the Q1077 splicing variant was examined. The phenotype of A1180V on the Q1077del splicing variant background remains to be determined.\n\n Most importantly, we found that the channel phenotype must be present in human carriers if it is to be pathogenic. Our clinical study, as guided by cellular experimental data, revealed a phenotype in the unaffected carriers that can be explained by the channel phenotype. We base this premise on the following analysis. First, the increased level of late Na \u03e9 current shown in the channel phenotype of A1180V predicted a prolongation of the QT interval. Indeed, we found that the QTc interval of the unaffected carrier group at rest was statistically longer than that of the noncarrier group, even though the difference was small and QTc intervals of all individual carriers were still normal. The prolongation disappeared with exercise. Such ratedependent QT prolongation is typically seen in patients with long-QT syndrome with an SCN5A mutation. 27 Thus, we conclude that the prolongation of QTc interval of carriers is substantial, and it is caused by the increased late Na \u03e9 current. Second, the rate-dependent A1180V channel current reduction predicted a wider QRS duration at high heart rate. In our study, the participants' heart rate was elevated through exercise. However, it has been well documented that exercise per se shortens QRS duration in healthy human subjects. 28 In our study, exercise consistently induced QRS shortening in the noncarrier group; interestingly, such shortening was blunted in the unaffected carrier group ( Figure 6 ). We interpret this relative widening of QRS duration to be a consequence of reduced Na \u03e9 current at high heart rate. In addition to the ratedependent change of QRS duration, we noticed that the resting QRS duration of the unaffected carrier group was significantly shorter than that of the noncarrier group, although for individuals their resting QRS durations still fell in the normal range ( Table 2) . Because women usually have slightly shorter QRS duration than men, 29 we have considered that the difference may be attributed to fewer male participants in the unaffected carrier group than the noncarrier group. However, we further found that a similar difference still exists between the female participants of 2 groups, suggesting that short QRS duration may also be a part of the phenotype of A1180V. A mechanistic explanation for short QRS is not readily available with the data from A1180V channels expressed in HEK293 cells. We speculate that the shorter QRS duration represents an increased Na \u03e9 current density, possibly because of an increased level of protein expression through an unclear mechanism that may be absent in HEK293 cells but present in the heart. For example, Mohler 18 reported that disruption of channel ankyrin-G interaction by mutation E1053K blocked Na \u03e9 expression in cardiomyocytes but not in HEK293 cells. Further study is needed to explain our observation. Finally, the results of exercise testing confirmed that all unaffected carriers had normal heart function and structure. Therefore, the phenotype shown in the ECG of the unaffected carriers precedes the development of any detectable conduction system defect and heart function abnormality, and most likely it is congenital.\n\n In conclusion, the findings of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that congenital disturbances of cardiac Na \u03e9 current due to SCN5A mutation can substantially contribute to the development of myocardial damage and, ultimately, to DCM. Thus, these findings strengthen the rationale for future studies in experimental models such as transgenic animals that would allow for more direct tests of the Na \u03e9 current hypothesis and provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenic link between cardiac Na \u03e9 channel abnormality and DCM.", "qa": [["63_44324793_6_1", "How do mutations in SCN5A, such as A1180V and R1193Q, affect cardiac Na+ channels and what potential implications does this have for myocardial damage?", "Mutations like A1180V and R1193Q lead to changes in cardiac Na+ channels, including a negative shift in inactivation, an increase in late Na+ current, and altered recovery from inactivation.

Because HIV testing serves an important function for early detection, mandatory vs. voluntary testing has remained a central question in public health policy debates (Amankwaa et al., 1999 (Amankwaa et al., , 2001 Blender, 1997; Blumberg & Langston, 1991; Kraemer, 2009) .

Given the urgent need to decrease new HIV infections, other important prevention policy recommendations have included access to condoms, bleach, and sterile needles to limit transmission (Parts, 1990; Zunker, 2012) . However, most prevention interventions did not take a comprehensive harm reduction approach. Despite the prevalence of HIV education programs, no state prisons provided clean syringes or injection drug equipment, and only two -California and Vermontprovided condoms to inmates (Lyons et al., 2014) . An additional recommendation not mentioned in our policy results could be the administration of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis medication as a preventative against new HIV infections, though the cost of such an intervention would likely require specific targeting of those inmates most at risk.\n\n Our results did not highlight many of the particular needs of incarcerated women, and women have historically been excluded from HIV/AIDS research. At the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, women were left out of the clinical trials, CDC monitoring, and other protection (Clark & Boudin, 1990 ). In addition, HIV seroprevalence rates are higher among female inmates due to their high engagement in risky sex (e.g., condomless and transactional sex, multiple partners, sex with IDU, or crack cocaine users) and IDU prior to incarceration, as well as their disproportionate experiences with sexual victimization during incarceration (Beck et al., 2013; Farel et al., 2013; St Lawrence et al., 1997) . Women are a fast-growing segment of the HIV-infected population, and they are disproportionately affected by IDU and heterosexual HIV transmission (West & Martin, 2000) . Though it is recognized that women and men have different perceptions of HIV, and female inmates have unique and higher demands for physical and psychological healthcare services, their medical and psychosocial needs were not met by adequate programming (Abiona, Adefuye, Balogun, & Sloan, 2009; Franklin et al., 2005; MacKenzie, Robinson, & Campbell, 1989; West & Martin, 2000) . Given their social vulnerabilities, women need particular empowerment and trainings on safe sex practices such as safer sex negotiation (Collica, 2002; Franklin et al., 2005) . Gender-specific HIV education, risk-reduction, and prevention programs are needed for female inmates as well as male inmates (Abiona et al., 2009; Franklin et al., 2005; St Lawrence et al., 1997; West & Martin, 2000) .\n\n Non-consensual sexan issue briefly touched upon in our policy results (Zunker, 2012 )can pose an HIV risk to all inmates, but represents a particular problem for women, gender non-conforming and transgender inmates, and MSM (Abiona et al., 2009; Beck et al., 2013; Farel et al., 2013) .

This analysis was performed only on capsular measurements to approximately 2.5 cm lateral to the glenoid. When the humeral insertion data were included, a significant thickness variation along each specimen was confirmed (P \u03fd .02).\n\n Various anatomic aspects of the shoulder capsule have been addressed in the literature. O'Brien et al. 13 reported that the inferior glenohumeral ligament is a complex structure consisting of an anterior band, a posterior band, and a diffuse thickening between the bands termed the axillary pouch. However, they made no reference to specific thickness measurements made in this region. While no attempt was made in the present study to section-specific capsular structures, the thickest capsule was encountered in quadrants B through D (4 o'clock to 8 o'clock), which correlates with the location of the axillary pouch. Capsular thickness then dropped to its thinnest value along quadrant E (9 o'clock) posteriorly. Other studies evaluated capsular thickness. [13] [14] [15] In research performed by Bigliani et al., 14 biomechanical properties of the inferior glenohumeral ligament were studied. In this study, the inferior glenohumeral ligament was divided into 3 anatomic regions: the superior band, the anterior portion of the axillary pouch, and the posterior portion of the pouch. Specimen thickness was then measured using an electro-optical micrometer at 7 locations along the ligament; however, no measurements from glenoid to humerus showing thickness trends were recorded. In another study, Itoi et al. 15 evaluated capsular thickness from midcapsule laterally to the humeral insertion. To ascertain the biomechanical properties of the lateral shoulder capsule, capsular thickness was measured in 4 quadrants; superior (12 o'clock), anterior (3 o'clock), inferior (6 o'clock), and posterior (9 o'clock). They encountered a significant difference in the capsular thickness in 4 different sites. They also found that the thickness of the anterior and superior capsule was greater than that of the posterior capsule. Our data concur with their findings; we found the posterior capsule the thinnest at 9 o'clock (quadrant E) and the thickest at 6 o'clock (quadrant C).\n\n In our study, we were unable to obtain full longitudinal sections in 6 shoulders because of the length restriction of our microtome blade. Our statistical analysis was based only on the intact longitudinal specimens that were measured to approximately 22.5 mm off the glenoid. We then sectioned those longer capsular sections within 3 to 5 mm of their humeral insertions and digitized them to establish the trend of capsular thinning laterally. The capsule thinned significantly from a mean of 3.03 mm at the glenoid to a mean of 2.17 mm at the humerus (P \u03fd .02). Zanotti et al., 12 while studying the anatomic structures at risk during arthroscopic capsular release, found the axillary nerve to be closest to the shoulder capsule, approximately 17 mm lateral to the glenoid, as it coursed inferior to the subscapularis. Because our thickness measurements were obtained at approximately 4-mm intervals, position 4 is the closest measurement we have to this location. The average capsule thickness in the area of the axillary nerve ranged from 2.05 mm (quadrant A) to 3.18 mm (quadrant C) ( Table 3) . These results provide guidelines for a safe depth of penetration when using thermal probes in this area.\n\n This analysis has some shortcomings. Thermal procedures for shoulder capsulorraphy have been described in a younger patient population; our specimens averaged 77 years of age. Other significant studies evaluating aspects of shoulder capsule thickness also used older specimens. 14, 15 While there have been reports on variations in the mechanical properties of the shoulder capsule associated with aging, 16 we are unaware of any published work on possible variations of capsule thickness associated with aging. This may be a topic worth continued research. Further, our specimens required flash freezing techniques in order to be sectioned for digitization, which may have affected the natural thickness. Our measurements differed from those of previous studies from 0.2 to 1.2 mm in different locations around the capsule. 14, 15 Although these differences may be attributed to our freezing of the capsule, they may also be the result of our more accurate computerized measurements.\n\n Shoulder capsular procedures have been described throughout the literature for the treatment of instability. More recently, nonablative thermal capsular shrinkage has been described for the arthroscopic treatment of instability. 17 Our study shows that the thickness of the shoulder capsule globally ranges from 2.22 \u03ee 0.98 mm to 2.97 \u03ee 1.5 mm, with quadrant C being the thickest on average and quadrant E the thinnest (Table  1) . These data may help determine the proper amount of thermal penetration when performing capsular shrinkage procedures. Computer digitization technology was used to measure capsule thickness to establish a platform for further study on the effects of thermal penetration on capsular healing. This study also provides safety guidelines for limits of depth of penetration when using thermal probes about the shoulder capsule.", "qa": [["50_20619263_1_1", "What are the potential implications of capsular thickening and thinning in different quadrants of the shoulder?\n", "Capsular thickening and thinning in different quadrants of the shoulder can have implications for shoulder stability and range of motion.

Due to the lack of information that would be helpful to patients in selecting their healthcare providers, their choice often depends on the reputation of health services providers (31) . Satir (32) suggested that the reputation of medical institutions should be assessed through patients' perceptions. The public sector is thought to be a knowledge-based industry, whose reputation depends on the perception that customers have of its services (33). Hibbard et al. (34) believe that a diminished hospital reputation can easily lead to a considerable drop in patient visits. A relevant article in Healthcare Collector (35) informs us that as much as 75% of patients use reputation as their primary criterion of choice. In specialised institutions, patients try to seek out those doctors who have gained more respect in the eyes of the people whose opinions they solicited (information by word of mouth).\n\n On the 'give' side of perceived service value equation price (36) is among the most important, because it is something that the customer has to consider sacrifice in order to obtain some products. The definition of price as a sacrifice is in line with other researchers' conceptualizations of this notion (37) . For Hafer (37) , this sacrifice includes, in the strictest sense, the monetary and non-monetary elements of the price, as well as the risks attached to the services rendered. The non-monetary element of the price is exclusively a function of time, and Hafer distinguishes between the time needed to get to the service provider, the time spent waiting for the service, and the time needed to finish the rehabilitation after the service is performed. Certainly, time spent waiting for some services to be performed is very important and may even be the most important aspect of health services. Other scholars include additional elements in the concept of non-monetary price. For instance, Sloan (38) , included ease of access and the waiting time for the service, i.e., the waiting queue (39) . Furthermore, certain psychological factors are also added to the aforementioned elements of the price, such as the patient's fear or apprehension, and the treatment upon admission to the facility for treatment (40, 41) .\n\n Considering the consequences of perceived service value, customer satisfaction is one of those mentioned most commonly. Oliver (42) defined satisfaction as a psychological phenomenon that results from one's expectations about the emotions and experiences prompted by a purchase. If a patient's expectations have been met, it results in their satisfaction. As stated, perceived service quality is defined as the difference between the expected and the perceived. The response to this is shown as satisfaction. Therefore, perceived service quality is an antecedent of customer satisfaction. Likewise, in healthcare, patient satisfaction represents a key indicator. Healthcare providers must understand their patients' expectations and strive to fulfil them (43) .\n\n Satisfied patients are important for healthcare providers too, because they tend to obey all instructions given by medical personnel, they spread positive reviews, and are more loyal to institutions with which they are satisfied (44) .\n\n The next consequence of perceived service value, customer loyalty, is defined by Oliver (42) as a commitment to repeat purchases, or the regular use of a product in the future, that actually leads to repeat purchases or the use of the same brand. Patient loyalty may be viewed more appropriately as a behavioural intention. Regardless of whether the discussion focuses on patient loyalty in the healthcare context, there is no question that the same benefits of customer loyalty apply -whether it is a hospital, bank, or retail business. Patients are loyal because they were satisfied in the past, so it is more important to find out why they were either satisfied or dissatisfied.\n\n Perceived service value is a customer's perception of the perceived service quality in comparison with other service providers (12) .\n\n Likewise, authors such as Cronin, Brady, and Hult (41) found that, besides the direct impact of perceived service quality on perceived service value, perceived service quality influences customer satisfaction.\n\n The higher the perceived service quality of a health service, the higher its perceived service value.\n\n The higher the perceived service quality of a health service, the higher the patient satisfaction. Reputation plays an important role in distinguishing between different healthcare service providers (45) . Researchers such as Chen (46) and Wood (47) show a positive connection between reputation and the perceived service value and quality of services.\n\n The higher the reputation of a health service provider, the higher its perceived service quality.\n\n The higher the reputation of a health service provider, the higher its perceived service value.\n\n Higher perceived service value leads to higher satisfaction (48) . In the long term, service providers' success is linked to customer loyalty (48).", "qa": [["64_52924802_1_1", "How does reputation impact the choice of healthcare providers for patients?", "Reputation plays a significant role in patients' selection of healthcare providers.

Symptoms and characteristics that are helpful in the diagnosis of cardiac herniation include a characteristic splashing murmur called a \"Bruit de Moulin, \" a hypotension that is unresponsive to fluid or pharmacological treatment and tachycardia [6] . The lethal aspect of cardiac herniation involves the torsion of the great vessels and subsequent loss of cardiac output.\n\n In this case, the diagnosis was delayed for 11 days. It is the opinion of the authors that without intervention the patient would have continued to deteriorate, and this injury would have resulted in mortality. On review of the case some salient features come to light. It is clear that multiple trauma played a role in the delay of diagnosis. Tachycardia, relative hypotension, and hypoxemia are all extremely nonspecific and could result from a multitude of etiologies including pain, empyema, pulmonary emboli, and bone marrow emboli. Upon exclusion of these etiologies, other causes must be investigated. In hindsight the initial CT scan of the chest, which was performed within 1 hour of the injury, demonstrates a few critical features which support the radiographic diagnosis of pericardial rupture and cardiac herniation. First, the left lower lobe is completely collapsed in the absence of significant pleural fluid (Figure 1 ) which is unique immediately following injury. Second, the heart has dramatically shifted leftwards and rests on the left lower lobe. And finally there is an abnormal structure visualized inside the left hemithorax which later proved to be the ruptured pericardium (Figure 3 ). The mechanism of cardiac herniation was probably due to the development of atelectasis in the left lower lobe resulting from the initial pericardial injury. Most likely, the atelectatic lung allowed the heart to herniate through the pericardial defect into the newly created space in the left chest cavity. Even with the assistance of modern scans, it is extremely difficult to effectively diagnose a pericardial rupture preoperatively and the above observations were only made in retrospect.\n\n Given the rarity of diagnosis and successful treatment of pericardial rupture and associated cardiac herniation, this case provides useful insight into a very unique condition. Due to its difficulty in recognition, pericardial rupture should be considered in all cases of blunt force chest trauma as it is likely lethal if gone untreated. Even with the aid of modern computerized tomography, successful preoperative diagnosis of a pericardial rupture with or without cardiac herniation is very difficult and has only seldom been reported in the literature [5, 7, 8] .
