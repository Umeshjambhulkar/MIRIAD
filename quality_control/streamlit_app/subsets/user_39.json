It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

AKI can modify patient outcomes and contribute to greater resource utilization and higher healthcare costs.\n\n Consensus statements by experts have recommended early personalized investigations, monitoring and management for AKI [4, 5] . The impact of these recommendations, which focus largely on harm avoidance, remains to be determined. One challenge in evaluating the impact of these and other care processes is a failure of early recognition of AKI [6] .\n\n In 1994, Rind et al. [7] proposed a computer algorithm to automatically track serum creatinine (SCr) changes and once a threshold was reached, send an alert to the responsible team. Recently, a number of studies have evaluated 'alerts' for detection of AKI [8] . Alerts have generally been triggered by detecting changes in SCr and/or urine output. However, the impact of these alerts on care processes and patient outcomes has been inconsistent [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This would imply that the benefit for implementing an electronic alert (e-alert) for detecting AKI remains uncertain.

Studies had to implement an e-alert using a clear operational definition for AKI and describe its impact on one or more care processes, patient-centred outcomes or resource utilization measures. Two authors (P.L., P.-M.V.) independently identified potentially eligible articles by an initial review of abstracts. This was followed by full-text review for potentially relevant studies fulfilling predefined eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (S.M.B.).\n\n Data were abstracted from relevant studies by the two same authors using a standardized electronic data form. Data extracted included publication-related information, study design and quality assessment. Data on patient demographics, comorbidity and case-mix, along with care process, patient and health resource-related outcomes were extracted. We also captured detailed descriptors of the e-alert. E-alert disruptiveness was rated using an a priori established intrusiveness scale [17] (Supplementary Appendix 3). Study quality was rated using the Modified Downs and Black checklist [19] .\n\n (i) Primary patient-centred outcome was all-cause mortality, as defined by each study.

No recurrences were observed at 1-year follow-up. It is the acute form of PL, an uncommon cutaneous disease mainly occurring in young adult men. Mucha-Haberman disease is not rare in children: 18.6% of the overall population in the series by Roman\u00ec et al 3 were children. In children, M-HD may be only a particular form of PL; in the largest series reported in the literature, 4-6 most patients had both acute and chronic lesions of PL simultaneously and a chronic course with some acute relapses. The disease M-HD is characterized by the abrupt onset of papulovesicles that evolve into necrotic lesions especially on the trunk (anterior area) and the arms (proximal part and flexor surfaces). Sometimes the eruption involves the entire body surface. Mucous membrane involvement is rare. The lesions are reddish brown papules with central vesiculation and sometimes hemorrhagic necrosis. Usually, the lesions evolve into varioliform scars which leave hypohyperpigmentation.\n\n The eruption is accompanied by only minimal general symptoms. Elevated temperature is a rare complication of M-HD; when fever is present, it is very high (up to 40\u00b0C-41\u00b0C) and frequently associated with asthenia, severe malaise, and intense myalgias, and the cutaneous eruptions are more severe with painful and large necrotic ulcers. This severe variety first reported by Degos et al 7 in 1966 occurs both in adults and children but it appears more frequent in childhood. In children some mucosal lesions have been observed. A central nervous system involvement is described with stupor, agitation, and neuropsychiatric alterations. Arthritis is a common associated complication.\n\n In patients with febrile M-HD, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and leukocyte count has been found; in a few cases, antistreptolysin A antibodies and eosinophils were increased. Despite bacteria being isolated from skin cultures, this is not considered the etiological agent of the disease. The histopathological findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the acute variety of M-HD and the occasional presence of circulating immune complexes suggest that the cutaneous lesions are the result of the vascular deposition of an infectious organism, which is the trigger factor of a reaction of hypersensitivity. Other reports suggest an association with a hyperimmune state in M-HD and febrile M-HD.\n\n The course of M-HD is usually self-limited to a few weeks or months, occasionally changing into a chronic course with exacerbations and remissions. The febrile variant may be prolonged for many months and may lead to death. Treatment with antibiotics has been recommended for control of the superinfection. Many other therapies have been proposed; however, no treatment seems completely effective in MH-D. The main treatments proposed in children with M-HD are erythromycin with a 1-to 5-month course, psoralen UV-A light treatment or only UV light treatment, and natural sunlight exposition, which all have had good responses in most patients, but the evaluation of their efficacy is difficult because of the tendency of PL to follow a selflimited natural clinical course.\n\n Differential diagnosis between M-HD and other papular or papulovesicular and crusted eruptions of childhood (in particular Crostis syndrome, varicella, and erythema multiformse) may be difficult, and the correct diagnosis is sometimes obtained only by histopathologic analysis.

Advanced preoperative preparations program, which was the anxiety reduction, distraction, video modeling and education, adding parents, no excessive reassurance, coaching, and exposure/shaping, reduced children's stress rather than the children in the control group.\n\n Children might vocalize their fears with crying and agitation. This was accompanied by significant physiological changes such as increase in heart rate and secretion of stress hormones. There were some risk factors. One was the children's factor and the other was perioperative environmental factors. The children's factors were age, temperament, previous medical encounters, attachment style and quality of parent-child relationship. From 9 months, there might present separation anxiety and peaked at 1 year old.\n\n Other factors were perioperative environmental factors, as increased levels of anxiety in children were associated with the number of people in the room at induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia induction was known to be the most anxiety provoking part of the preoperative experience.\n\n In pediatric patients' slow induction, the children were anesthetized through a mask. We thought that the mask would cause stress for the children. The objective of this study was to determine if video assisted anesthesia inductions reduced the children's stress regarding a decrease in pulse rate and the behavioral score in pediatric patients.\n\n With approval from the local ethical committee and parental oral and written informed consent, ASA physical states score I-II, seventy five children from two to ten years old were included in this prospective observational study. Exclusion criteria included patients having mental retardation, a developmental delay, and having received several operations under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 was aged two to three years old, group 2 was aged four to six years old, and group 3 was aged seven to ten years old. All patients underwent preoperative fasting. The operation time was estimated to be less than 3 hours. The following three characteristics were evaluated: 1) the pulse rate at four points (the children's ward, the entrance at the operating room, at the mask notification, and the mask fit); 2) the behavioral score at four points; 3) the amount of painkillers on the postoperative day. We evaluated the percentage of pulse rate based on the children's word. The pediatric patients were divided into two groups: the control group and video assisted induction group by the envelop methods to select the randomization to removing selection bias.\n\n No patients received premedication. In the children's ward, the nurse measured the pulse rate by the oximetry monitor. At the entrance to the operation room, children in the video assisted induction group chose a DVD by themselves from twelve different kinds of DVD. In group 1 (age two to three years old), it was difficult to choose the DVD by themselves so the parents helped them in choosing a DVD. Then the pulse oximetry monitor was worn on the patients' finger. They could watch the DVD from the entrance to the operating room. In the control group, the only children entered the operating room without a DVD player. The children were separated with their parents at the entrance of operating room. From the entrance of operating room, after the children were on the operation table, we measured the pulse rate again by pulse oximeter. However, we did not use the non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and electrocardiography at this point. Then we talked about the face mask, which was soft, and showed the mask to the children. At this point, we measured the pulse rate as they looked at the mask. After we discussed the mask, the children attached the mask to their face. At the same time, the pulse rate was measured as the mask was fit. At this point, patients in haled only the oxygen even if slow induction was chosen. From at the entrance of operating room, the supervisor anesthesiologist checked the behavioral score. The behavioral score was chosen the number of distress behaviors: crying, screaming, nonverbal resistance and verbal resistance as Chorney previously described [2] . Standard monitoring such as non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiography, capnography (Compact airway modules E-CAiOV, GE Heathcare, NJ) and bispectral index was applied after they lost consciousness by general anesthesia. Anesthesia induction was standardized as above, but was left to the discretion of the experienced pediatric anesthesiologists using either propofol or sevoflurane induction. After the operation, the pediatric patients received painkillers NSAIDs prospectively.\n\n Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).

The method did not achieve high sensitivity and specificity due to a considerable dispersion and overlapping of values in patients who remained normotensive and those who developed nonproteinuric hypertension or preeclampsia. It may, however, add some prognostic information since the probability of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia was approximately 3 times higher among subjects with a positive test, defined by a kallikrein-creatinine ratio below the best discriminating threshold, than in the whole study population.\n\n Another family of vasoactive peptides that may be involved in the adaptive response to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and its related peptides. In the third trimester, the plasma levels of the N-terminal peptide of pro-ANP are higher in preeclamptic women than in healthy pregnant controls and also higher in women with severe preeclampsia than in women with mild preeclampsia (278) . Furthermore, the N-terminal peptide of pro-ANP is particularly elevated in the subgroup of hypertensive pregnancies with abnormal Doppler velocimetry (278) . Despite these encouraging observations in late gestation, an attempt to measure the N-terminal peptide of pro-ANP in second-trimester serum samples failed to detect any difference between women who later developed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension and those who remained normotensive (250) . Hence, this peptide does not work well as a predictive marker for second-trimester screening of women at risk for preeclampsia. ANP is synthesized by the human placenta, but there is no evidence that the elevated circulating levels reflect placental production (279) . This may explain why ANP is not altered in the preclinical stage of preeclampsia. With the development of new assays, other ANP-related peptides may become future candidate markers of preeclampsia.\n\n Potent vasoconstrictor substances have been identified in human placenta, some of which are more abundantly expressed in preeclampsia. For example, endothelin-1 mRNA and immunoreactive protein were found to be increased in preeclamptic placentas (280, 281) . Although maternal plasma endothelin-1 levels have been found to be elevated in the first trimester of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (282), a cohort study comprising all trimesters of gestation did not confirm such an association (283) . Recently, a neuropeptide classified as tachykinin and named \"neurokinin B\" was identified in human placental tissue (284) . Women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia showed high plasma concentrations of this peptide, which was able to cause hypertension in pregnant rats. It is possible that vasoconstrictor peptides such as endothelin-1 and neurokinin B represent the link between placental vascular malformation and blood pressure elevation in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Although these substances are interesting therapeutic targets, current evidence does not support their use as diagnostic or predictive tools.\n\n The placenta is a source of progesterone and its derivatives, 5\u2423-pregnane-3\u2423-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) and 5\u2423-dihydroprogesterone, and its precursor, pregnenolone sulfate (285) . These hormones are neurosteroids (steroid hormones synthesized by the nervous system) that may contribute to the neurochemical and behavioral changes of pregnancy and puerperium. It has been hypothesized that the neuroendocrine effects of progesterone explain, in part, some neural/behavioral symptoms of preeclampsia (227) .\n\n The measurement of maternal serum progesterone levels did not result into a powerful index of placental function and neither progesterone nor 5\u2423-dihydroprogesterone levels identified women at risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension (286, 287) . In further support of these observations, a recent longitudinal study showed no change in progesterone levels associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (288) . A multiple marker cohort study involving more than 1,000 nulliparous women found that progesterone levels assayed between 25 and 34 wk of gestation were higher in women who eventually presented with preeclampsia, but the accuracy of progesterone as a predictive marker was low in the third trimester and negligible in the second trimester (233) .\n\n Allopregnanolone seems more promising as a predictive marker of preeclampsia.", "qa": [["8_19101411_13_1", "How do vasoactive peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), potentially contribute to the development of preeclampsia?\n", "Vasoactive peptides, including ANP, may play a role in the adaptive response to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy like preeclampsia.

Since both RASA1 and KRIT1 genes interact with the Rap1a protein, this suggests the possibility of a shared genetic pathway between KTWS and cavernous angiomas.

Although margins in the United States are still very high, industry unit sales are more or less flat and there is increasing competition for market shares among a growing number of brands. 1 2 Price cutters are making it more difficult for the leading brand to increase revenue. There is some likelihood of excise tax increases. Negative public and interest group reaction to publicity about nicotine manipulation and the targeting of young people, plus the increasingly diYcult political and legal climate for tobacco companies, make the future of the American smokeless tobacco market appear less bright than in the past. 3 The Canadian market seems a natural choice for expansion. Its physical proximity and relative similarity make it attractive from a management perspective. Unlike some European and Asian countries which have tried to bar smokeless tobacco products, American brands of snuV and chewing tobacco are available in Canada and channels of distribution are established. Advertising in American publications reaches members of the Canadian target market. Although market penetration is very low compared with the United States, there is a base to work from. The age profiles of males in the two countries are very similar and there is growing interest in Canada in the sports that are part of the \"smokeless tobacco culture\". 4 Canada's relatively large aboriginal population has a high rate of smokeless tobacco use. 5 Smoking among young Canadian males has increased in recent years and cigar sales have boomed. 6 Restrictions on smoking in public places in Canada encourages those addicted to nicotine to seek alternatives to cigarettes. There is not likely another market in the developed world which can be as easily exploited.\n\n This article examines those factors that make Canada an attractive market for American and Swedish producers of smokeless tobacco products. A review of the literature identified demographic, belief, and marketing variables related to the consumption of smokeless tobacco. Strategies by which the increased exploitation of the Canadian smokeless tobacco market can be deterred are discussed.\n\n Smokeless tobacco has two product types: snuV and chewing tobacco. Historically, snuV was finely ground tobacco inhaled through the Tobacco Control 1999; 8:411-420 nostrils. In the contemporary market, snuV is ground or shredded tobacco, which may be sweetened or flavoured, and is taken orally. Although there are three diVerent categories of snuV-dry, moist and fine cut-moist is the market leader in Canada and the United States. Chewing tobacco, which is far coarser than snuV, is also produced in three diVerent forms: loose leaf (the most popular), plug, and twist. Chewing tobacco has lost market share in recent years in Canada and the United States.\n\n A snuV user places a portion of the product (perhaps enclosed in a teabag-like container) between the cheek or lower lip and the gum where it mixes with the saliva and releases nicotine. Chewing tobacco is inserted in the cheek pouch and chewed to facilitate the release of the nicotine. 7 Moist snuV is the fastest growing segment, encouraged by innovations that make the product more palatable to beginners. Recent product innovations include one that is sweet and gummy and another that masks the tobacco taste and does not require spitting. 8 \n\n Brands produced by the United States Tobacco Company (UST) enjoy the widest distribution in Canada. Smokeless tobacco brands made by other American and Swedish manufacturers are available, but on a more limited basis.\n\n UST, Conwood Tobacco, Helme Tobacco, Pinkerton Tobacco, and Brown and Williamson are the leading moist snuV manufacturers in the United States. Pinkerton Tobacco, Conwood Tobacco, National Tobacco, and Helme Tobacco are the top names in loose-leaf chewing tobacco. The dominant moist snuV brands are Copenhagen, Kodiak, and Skoal Long Cut. Principal looseleaf chewing tobacco labels are Red Man, Levi Garrett, Beech-nut, and Lancaster. Each of these brands has diVerent physical characteristics (coarseness of tobacco, sweetness, flavour, pouch or loose, amount of free nicotine) designed to appeal to diVerent market segments. For example, snuV starter brands such as Skoal Bandits and Flavor Packs are sweeter and less potent. 8 9 10 Brand images are based around notions of masculinity, freedom, adventure, sports and \"coolness\"; in many cases the brand message is presented in healthful outdoor settings.\n\n Smokeless tobacco is a highly profitable product. The market leader, UST, ranks in the top 200 largest publicly held companies in the United States, based on market value. Eighty-six per cent of UST's almost US$1.4 billion in revenue comes from smokeless tobacco.

[3] [4] [5] [6] Shockwave therapy (SWT) relies on external energy sources depositing pulses of energy into a fluid environment, then propagating the harnessed energy until it meets the target tissue where the energy is deployed. 7 Though SWT has played an important role in the treatment of urolithiasis for decades, recent advancements have allowed for broader applications. In a low-intensity state, SWT appears to induce angiogenesis and improve perfusion in target tissues. 8 Cardiologists have employed SWT for patients with refractory angina, while orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists have explored its role in tendinitis and nonhealing bone fractures. [9] [10] [11] The precise mechanism of neoangiogenesis is not completely understood; however, it appears that there is a release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor in response to cell membrane microtrauma and mechanical stress. 12 VEGF is an important mediator of neoangiogenesis and collateral blood flow formation, and an increased concentration of this cytokine has been demonstrated in multiple basic science studies. 13, 14 Clinically, increased penile angiogenesis should demonstrate an increase in penile blood flow and erectile function. 15 SWT has also been shown to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression through activation of PERK/ ATF4 signaling pathway, 16 which offers a putative mechanism for a neuronal regenerative effect and may implicate this treatment in cavernous nerve injury models of ED.\n\n Though several studies have examined the use of LiESWT in ED, most lack a placebo control, and have a heterogeneous design and data analysis, which render rigorous interpretation difficult.

These problems persist and have been the focus of two recent systematic reviews Ross et al., 1999) . The majority of papers are from cancer research, from North America and are hospital based. The scale and nature of the problem is not yet so well documented for trials in general practice, but one would expect them to be similar if not exacerbated because of the less well developed research culture in general practice and the generalist nature of primary care, such that even conditions of high prevalence constitute only a minor part of the workload.\n\n Multi-practice projects may fail at several levels; either because too few practices are willing to participate, because having agreed to take part practices do not recruit sufficient patients or fail to follow the trial protocol.\n\n Previous studies have focused on the factors identified by individual primary care practitioners as barriers to involvement, both for collaborative research (Gray et al., 2001 ) and questionnaire studies (McAvoy and Kaner, 1996; Kaner et al., 1998) .

Chromosomal abnormality in long arm of chromosome 8[8q22] and long arm of chromosome 6 have been reported to be associated with this syndrome. Three genes were located in area 6p21, these are TCTE1, MUT and Cbfa1 (Run 2) from which the gene for the transcription factor Cbfa1 (core binding factor) was thought to be most likely responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n The abnormal process of osteoblastic differentiation was found responsible for the anomalies of bone development and growth. In particular, due to the insufficiency of transcription factor Cbfa1, its target genes are not activated, namely the genes of osteocalcin, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), MMP13 (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase), collagen type 10a1, osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase, which in turn are characteristic cellular products of osteoblastic cells.\n\n The study of the cellular mechanisms of dental eruption on heterozygotic Cbfa1 test animal subjects revealed a decreased number of osteoclasts that contribute to normal resorption of the alveolar bone during tooth eruption. The decreased number of osteoclasts in patients with cleidocranial dysplasia leads to delayed eruption and increased number of impacted teeth.\n\n Cbfa1 regulates morphogenetic mechanisms of growth and development of the skeleton, as well as gene expression in the mesenchymal cells of dental epithelium. Its deficiency leads to manifestation of dental anomalies related to delayed eruption and impaction of the permanent teeth of patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. The presence of supernumerary teeth not only obstructs eruption and produces impaction of permanent successor teeth but also leads to morphological dysplasias of the crowns and more commonly the roots of the permanent teeth due to deficiency of sufficient space for proper development. In conclusion, the deficiency of transcription factor Cbfa1 in cleidocranial dysplasia leads to a deregulation of the morphogenetic mechanisms of skeletal and dental development and growth. 1, 9 Pycnodysostosis or the Marteaux-Lamy syndrome presents identical features as cleidocranial dysplasia except presence of dwarfism, dense and fragile bones.

We have observed an increase in NMDA receptor 2 A/B subunits in CD brains as compared to non-CD, with GAP-43 positive axons surrounding the NR2A/B positive areas on the neuronal cell bodies 37 . Previous reports also showed that blocking ScIentIfIc RepoRts | (2017) 7:17702 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-17377-z NMDA receptors prevents the increased expression of GAP-43; making NMDA receptors an attractive upstream candidate for GAP-43 regulation 41, 49 . The potential role of GAP-43 in epileptogenesis after a second hit is further highlighted in CD animals following GAP-43 knockdown. The knockdown of GAP-43 reduced the peak seizure severity after PTZ induced acute seizures. Moreover, the reduction in interictal spike frequency following the acute seizure, or \"second hit\", provides further evidence for a role of GAP-43 in epileptogenesis. Excitatory post-synaptic protein PSD-95 was significantly reduced with GAP-43 knockdown. This may contribute to the observed inhibition of chronic epileptogenesis. Further research is warranted to investigate the downstream targets that may play a role in modulation of a pro-epileptic neuronal network. The mechanisms involved in the increased expression of GAP-43 protein are likely multifactorial. For example, an intrinsic program-driven transcription of GAP-43 expression, supported by previously published results showing increased GAP-43 mRNAs in dysmorphic neurons 50, 51 . Levels of GAP-43 in the serum were elevated after spontaneous seizures, but not prior to their onset. The abrupt increase in GAP-43 levels in the serum is observed at day 120, but not day 100. Similarly, while interictal spikes continuously increase up to 120 days, we did not observe spontaneous seizures until 120 days after PTZ. There was also a correlation between serum GAP-43 levels and interictal spikes at days 100 and 120. This phenomenon must be further explored, and future studies should focus on protein changes at day 120 and later. We also observed (using immuno-EM) aggregated GAP-43 protein in the capillary lumen of CD + SS rats, but did not observe this phenomenon in other groups. These observations suggest that the post-ictal GAP-43 serum level increase could be due to leakage secondary to a seizure-induced breakdown of the blood brain barrier 26, 27 . In summary, our results indicate that the sustained increase of GAP-43 in dysplastic, but not in control brains, is involved in epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. This rather specific expression of GAP-43 may point to a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism for expression of epileptogenicity and disease progression in epilepsy due to CD. We postulate that during the latent period, molecular/cellular changes, such as aberrant axonal sprouting, occur in the CD brain resulting in the development and growth of local, highly excitable and electrophysiologically synchronized epileptic network(s).

All pups were grown to adulthood of post-natal day 55 (PND55) prior to experimental procedures, which is when non-CD and CD animals weigh roughly the same weight, therefore reducing possible differences in drug metabolism.\n\n Characterizing GAP-43 expression after acutely generalized seizure. In order to account for potential molecular changes caused by surgical implantation of EEG electrodes, parallel groups of rats were studied with and without EEG. In the first set of experiments, 50 rats (25 non-CD, 25 CD) without surgical manipulations were injected with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) at a sub-convulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.). This subconvulsive dose only induces seizures in a small portion of normal/non-irradiated rats, but it leads to status epilepticus in the vast majority of CD rats 23 .

To get an indication of the part of ILI associated with mortality associated with influenza we did a sub-analysis, where we reduced ILI in the beginning and end of the period with activity; based on the assumption that the major part of ILI will be influenza at the peak whereas influenza will not be a major contributor to ILI when ILI is low. This analysis was termed influenza-associated mortality.\n\n To estimate the association between weekly mortality, and influenza activity and extreme temperatures for the seasons 1994/5 to 2009/10 (week 27, 1994 to week 26, 2010), we used a multivariable time-series model with calendar week (wk) as underlying time unit, stratified by where MR is the Mortality Rate, D number of allcause deaths and N is the none-stochastic size of the population.\n\n We used an additive Poisson regression model (link = id) with 1/population-size as offset parameter and allowing for overdispersion. For each age group and gender, the model for E(D) could formally be described as (omitting regression constants and parameters to be estimated): where the terms spline(wk) and the sine and cosine terms express the baseline with trend and seasonality. Trend was included as a cubic spline, and both a yearly and half-yearly seasonal cycles were included as sines and cosines. Impact of influenza activity (IA) may be heterogeneous between seasons [23] . Hence, IA was included separately for each season s (season: week 27 to week 26 the following year): \u2211 s \u2211 wk IA. In the primary analysis IA was expressed as proportion of weekly ILIconsultations. Impacts of extreme temperatures were separated in weeks with extreme summer or winter temperatures, and include as the four variables: wc = winter cold, ww = winter warm, sc = summer cold and sw = summer warm ( Figure 1 ). Further, deaths may be delayed relative to when IA was registered at a consultation or relative to when the temperature was extreme. Therefore, IA and extreme temperature event from the preceding week were also included. Finally, to compensate major unexplained peaks (outliers), residuals greater than 1.5 standard deviations, lasting 3 week or more and not explained by IA or extreme temperatures were included as artificial epidemic-parameters to compensate these (\u2211epi).\n\n In order to obtain a more conservative estimation of influenza-associated mortality (rather than ILI), we applied an influenza-index to express influenza activity (IA), created by reducing the ILI consultation percentage for each season. This was done by multiplying the ILI consultation percentage in a specific season with a normal distribution, with mean and standard derivation as for the ILI percentage over the same season. This reduces the ILI percentage in the beginning and end of the season, and maintains the ILI percentage at the height of the season (Figure 2 ).

Exertional fatigue in TR is widely believed to be caused by low cardiac output 1, 2, 6 based on invasive studies performed at rest 5 and noninvasive exercise studies. 7 However, impaired cardiac output reserve with exercise has never been directly proven in TR, and its mechanisms remain unclear. The causes of exertional dyspnea in TR also remain obscure, because the primary lesion sits upstream of the pulmonary capillary-alveolar interface. However, left heart filling pressures may increase even in the absence of left heart disease when there is right heart congestion and pericardial restraint, as in TR. 8 To better understand the hemodynamic basis for impaired exercise tolerance in TR, we performed invasive hemodynamic cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with moderate and severe TR in the absence of significant left heart or pulmonary vascular disease and compared them with age-and sex-matched controls without TR or heart failure (HF).\n\n Consecutive patients with symptomatic grade 3 or 4 TR (exertional dyspnea and fatigue) and no significant left heart disease undergoing exercise hemodynamic catheterization at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2002 to 2014 were included. Patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] <45%), significant leftsided valvular disease (>mild), significant pulmonary hypertension (>mild), pulmonary parenchymal disease, prior chest radiation, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, pericardial disease, and congenital heart disease were excluded. TR severity was graded by echocardiography in accordance with current guidelines. 2 Control subjects frequency-matched by age, sex, and body size were referred for invasive exercise assessment for dyspnea but had no demonstrable cardiac pathology after thorough clinical evaluation and invasive hemodynamic assessment, including normal rest and exercise pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (rest <25 mm Hg; exercise <40 mm Hg) and normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP; rest <15 mm Hg; exercise <25 mm Hg).\n\n Clinical data were abstracted from the medical charts. Twodimensional and Doppler echocardiography was performed according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines by experienced sonographers and cardiologists with grading of TR severity according to established criteria. 2, 9 Right ventricular (RV) length and diastolic diameters were measured at the base and midventricle perpendicularly to septum, and tricuspid annular dimension was measured in the apical 4-chamber view.\n\n 2,10 RV function was assessed by systolic annular tissue velocity of the lateral tricuspid annulus (s\u2032) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. 10 The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board, and all subjects provided written informed consent for review of their medical records. There were no eligible participants who refused to provide consent.\n\n Subjects were studied on chronic medication in the fasted state, after minimal sedation in the supine position as previously described. 11 Right heart catheterization was performed using a 7F catheter through a 9F sheath via the internal jugular vein. Transducers were leveled and zeroed at the phlebostatic axis, measured by laser calipers. Pressures in the right atrium (RAP), PA, and PCWP positions were measured at end expiration, taking the average of 3 beats in sinus rhythm and \u22655 in atrial fibrillation (AF). RAP and PCWP was measured mid A wave for subjects in sinus rhythm and at mid C wave for subjects with AF. PCWP position was confirmed by fluoroscopy, characteristic pressure waveforms, and oximetry (saturation >94%).

Though the infection rate following TKAs has decreased primarily due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics, the current infection rate is reported to be 1-2% for primary TKAs and 4-8% for revision surgery [1, 9, 10] . And infection following TKA remains a formidable challenge to both surgeons and patients [4] .\n\n The management modalities used to treat infected TKR can be categorised as single-stage reimplantation (removal of an infected TKA with irrigation and debridement and reimplantation of a new TKA during same operation) and two-stage reimplantation. The first step in the two-stage reimplantation procedure involves prosthesis removal with irrigation and debridement and cement spacer insertion. Thus, new prostheses are implanted after infections have been eradicated. Twostage reimplantation has success rates from 90% to 96% and remains the gold standard for the treatment of infected TKAs [2, 19] . Antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers (AICS) are available as static and mobile types. Static AICS have been used to deliver high doses of antibiotics locally and to minimise contractures of collateral ligaments, thus facilitating second-stage reimplantation [18] . Due to immobilisation between surgical stages, static AICS result in joint stiffness and exposure difficulty at time of reimplantation; accordingly, mobile AICS were developed to solve these problems [13, 15] .\n\n The purpose of this study was to compare clinical results and radiological changes associated with the use of static and mobile AICS for the treatment of infected TKA.\n\n \n\n From July 2000 to May 2005, 20 patients were treated by using static AICS and from June 2003 to February 2007, 16 patients were treated by using mobile AICS for infected TKAs. All patients were followed-up for at least two years after revision TKA. In the static group, there were two men and 18 women, with a mean overall age of 66.5 years (range, 49-77 years). The mean follow-up after two-stage reimplantation was 36 months (range, 24-62 months). In the mobile group, there were two men and 14 women with a mean age of 60.2 years (range, 47-72 years), and the mean follow-up after two-stage reimplantation was 29 months (range, 25-45 months). Finally, ten patients were referred for uncontrolled infected knee arthroplasty from other hospitals. The mean interval from primary TKA to a diagnosis of infected TKA was 11.3 months (range, 2.5-48 months). The infecting organisms in the two study groups are shown in Table 1 . Successful two-stage reimplantation was defined as no evidence of infection at least one year after revision TKA. Clinically we evaluated success rates, average range of motion (ROM), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores [14] , as well as Knee Society (KS) pain and function scores [7] prior to revision TKA and at last follow-up visits after revision TKA. The knee ROM and clinical results were checked using goniometer and questionnaire by one orthopaedic surgeon (S. J. Park). An average ROM measurement was conducted three times and we used the average of the three values.\n\n Ambulation methods during AICS placement and exposure methods at revision TKAs were compared. We assessed bone loss by comparing radiographs obtained immediately after AICS placement with those obtained before reimplnatation ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). The amount of bone loss in the patients who received static and mobile spacers was evaluated by overlapping two radiographs obtained immediately postoperatively and before reimplantation, and spacer migration as well as radiolucency at the bone-cement interface were evaluated.\n\n Operative technique and the protocol used to eradicate infection During the first stage surgery, all patients underwent extensive debridement at the time of implant removal. A complete synovectomy was performed, and all non-viable soft tissues and bone were resected. Medullary canals were thoroughly debrided.

The subgroups analyses are commonly performed because the effect of a measurement might vary among subgroups of subjects, defined by individual characteristics. In order to consolidate the validity of the results, several sub-group analyses were developed, taking into consideration the following: gender (male and female separately), protective equipment used (nothings or gloves and masks versus at least gloves, masks, and air-flow cabinet), and work task (excluding studies that considered nurses not exposed to ANDs as controls).\n\n A cumulative analysis is a sequence of meta-analyses, aiming to estimate the changes of the ES starting with a single study and adding the other studies one at a time. The cumulative analysis accumulates the results from the first to the latest study, and each successive result includes a synthesis of all previous studies. This analysis expresses the potential consistency of the results [26] . We performed the cumulative analysis both chronologically (adding each study according to the year of publication) and considering the sample size (from smallest to biggest).\n\n To explore potential moderators of these observed effects, owing to a third variable, we examined the variation in ES associated with the continent where the studies were conducted (categorized in Europe, America, and Asia), and year of publication, categorized into three groups (the first group consisted of studies until 2004, the second between 2005 and 2010, and the third after 2010 until today).

A grading scale was applied ranging from 0 = no VR spaces to 1 = 1-3, 2 = 4-7, and 3 = 1 7 VR spaces as described by Achiron and Faibel [9] . The side with more VR spaces at each level was used for grading [13] . VR spaces were considered to be dilated if they were 6 2 mm [9] . As above, the side with more dilated VR spaces was used in the analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed McNemar test.\n\n At the three evaluated levels, a greater number of VR spaces were noted in the supraventricular region with 20 (25%) of 80 patients with MS and 24 (30.3%) of 80 subjects who had a frequency of grade 3 ( 1 7). At the midbrain level a large number of patients (72, 90%) and controls (75-93.8%) did not have any VR spaces. The greatest number of VR spaces at the level of the lenticulostriate vessels was noted to be grade 1 (1-3 VR spaces) in both patients and controls. Importantly, there was no increase noted in the frequency of nondilated VR spaces in the MS group compared to the control group at all levels. In fact, the number was smaller in MS patients compared to controls in the supraventricular region. At the other two levels, the number was comparable ( table 1 ) .\n\n There was no difference between MS patients and controls at levels 1 and 2 in the number of dilated VR spaces with no dilated VR spaces in patients or controls In the control group, there were 8 (7.5%) dilated VR spaces in 6 patients, between 1 and 2 in each. The calculated p value for dilated VR spaces at the supraventricular level was ! 0.0001. \n\n In our study, in the supraventricular region, there was a significantly larger number of dilated VR spaces noted in patients with recently diagnosed MS than in the controls.\n\n There was, however, no significant increase in the frequency of VR spaces in MS patients compared to controls at the midbrain level, basal ganglia and in the supraventricular region.\n\n VR spaces are potentially one of the most important entry routes of soluble proteins as well as of leukocytes into the central nervous system [14] , believed to be associated with the transfer of soluble factors between the extracellular fluid of the brain and the CSF. This has been elucidated through ultrastructural studies and also through the intracerebral injection of tracer substances [15] . Macrophages containing major histocompatibility complex antigens can trap foreign antigens entering the brain [16, 17] . The accumulation of activated macrophages in large numbers and T and B lymphocytes can result in a significant immune response, as occurs in MS. The demyelinating lesions of MS are typically situated adjacent to veins or on pial and ependymal surfaces. There are cuffs of inflammatory cells present in VR spaces as a prominent feature of acute MS plaques, and this perivascular accumulation of cells could either be due to the resultant overflow of immune response or the stimulating antigens being confined to cells in the perivascular spaces [10] .\n\n There have been several studies that have found a higher incidence of dilated VR spaces in hypertension [5] , white matter lesions of leukoaraiosis [18] , dementia [6] and retinopathy in diabetics [19] and have suggested an association of dilated VR spaces with disease entities related to small vessel disease. In a recent study, Zhu et al. [20] evaluated a large cohort of elderly subjects and found a strong association between the severity of dilated VR spaces and age and hypertension. The severity was also related to the volume of white matter leukoaraiosis and lacunar infarctions as seen on MRI. They concluded that there appeared to be an independent association between the degree of dilatation of VR spaces and age, hypertension, volume of white matter hyperintensities, and lacunar infarctions, and accordingly suggested that dilated VR spaces be considered another marker of cerebral small vessel disease in the elderly.", "qa": [["38_5673825_1_1", "What are the potential implications of dilated VR spaces in the central nervous system?\n", "Dilated VR spaces in the central nervous system may serve as entry routes for soluble proteins and leukocytes, facilitating the transfer of soluble factors between the brain's extracellular fluid and the cerebrospinal fluid.
