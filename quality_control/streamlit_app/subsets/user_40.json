It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

This provides an efficient means to see where WVC hotspots occur regardless of the scale extent the map is viewed at. Carcass locations also can be overlaid on one of seven different base maps. The high-resolution aerial imagery base map provides an excellent backdrop for analyzing WVC patterns, because landscape features such as vegetation, rivers, human developments, agricultural fields, and roads are clearly visible at smaller scale extents. Additionally, the terrain base map shades relief making topography appear three dimensional, which is helpful for viewing carcass location with respect to major topographic features such as drainages. To add additional context not available in the base maps, we included GIS layers for wildlife crossing locations, exclusionary fencing, marker locations, and management regions (UDOT and UDWR) that can be toggled on and off by the user. The map viewer also includes data filters (date, species, and management region) allowing the user to modify data to suit their specific needs. For fine-scale WVC analysis, users can also enter a highway number (e.g., US 6) and section (e.g., markers 210-213), and the map viewer will zoom to that location and summarize WVC data for that area (Figure 2) . Finally, the map viewer allows displayed data to be exported as a PDF, which provides the user with a way to share data or create figures for reports.\n\n While the map viewer provides an efficient means to visualize WVC patterns, in some situations it may be desirable to perform more sophisticated spatial analyses (e.g., spatial clustering or autocorrelation indices). To facilitate this, the desktop web application allows the user to download the WVC Reporter database as either an ESRI shapefile or a dbf file. The shapefile is a common GIS format that allows carcasses location to be easy imported into GIS software where spatial analyses can be performed. The download function also respects the data filters in the desktop web application.\n\n When designing the desktop web application, we realized not all agency personnel reporting WVC collision data would have access to smartphones and consequently some information would still be collected on paper forms. To address this situation, the desktop web application has a report form for manually entering carcass locations. It essentially functions the same as the mobile web application report form, with the exception that the user has to define the carcass location manually by either entering GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude or UTM), the highway/marker, or the street address. Once the location information is entered, the user is able to verify that the location information was correct by viewing the location on a built-in map viewer.\n\n The final function of the desktop web application is to serve as a location to link to the mobile web application. Before field technicians can use the mobile application on their individual smartphones, they must first access the web application (https:// wvc.mapserv.utah.gov/wvc/desktop/index.php), click on the mobile app link, and then bookmark the location on their smartphone. The desktop web application was programmed using the same languages as the mobile application, and it works with nearly all commonly used web browsers (Internet Explorer 7+, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).\n\n We tested the WVC reporter application using a Motorola Droid X smartphone (Model 10083V2-B-K1, Verizon, New York, New York, USA) and an Apple iPhone 4 (Model A1349, Apple, Inc., Cupertino, California, USA).

The majority of professionals therefore have a limited understanding of this model, especially since medical schools faculties are generally made up of biomedically-trained professionals, thus promoting a focus on the fragmentation of care and super-specialization. This training is therefore insufficient to ensure that physicians gain the necessary competences, skills, attitudes, values, and emotional structure necessary to promote transversal care 20 . Another limiting factor is having the technology necessary for promoting health actions in the information era. In the present day, the flow of health information within care systems has undergone profound changes. What was once restricted is now available to everybody, including staff and patients. Therefore, matrix working cannot be understood in the same way as it was 30 years ago.\n\n Access to information is wider and has permitted a change to the logical construction of health system structural capital gain. Social media and search engines have contributed to this change 21 . Today, access to health information can both help and confuse patients and health professionals alike, making the curatorship of knowledge essential in the joint construction of the knowledge necessary for patient care 22 .\n\n This new reality requires professionals with the adequate skills, knowledge, and tools to tailor care to their patients' needs and therefore ensure the provision of quality care 23 . The concept of matrix working seen through the lens of referral and back referral assumes the existence of a generalist with an immense variety of very shallow knowledge 24 . However, in the present day this representation is rather outdated, given the complexity of problems, multiple patient demands, and the fact that patient access to health information is constantly improving 24 .\n\n The modern understanding of matrix working should be the provision of support by professionals and diverse specialist areas, enabling the dynamic use of structural capital by interdisciplinary teams to widen the scope of action and improve the quality of care provision 13, 25 . The unidirectional flow of information for clinical decision-making therefore ceases to exist and the collaborative coordination of care emerges and each of point of delivery in the health system makes its own contribution to the process.\n\n For this rupture to occur, it is necessary to create a single database base that can be used by all health professionals, such as that created by Department Order 1357 (December 6, 2018) (Chart 1), and envisages knowledge management and a change in the concept of specialist doctor.\n\n The classical definition of specialist and generalist, where the former masters a specific area and the other has limited knowledge of a variety of areas, is outdated. In the current context, it is important to recognize what we call the \"multifocal specialist\".\n\n The multifocal specialist masters more common areas with the necessary depth of knowledge to provide adequate treatment, which can, with the uses of information access mechanisms, be equal to or greater than that of the \"focal specialist\" in certain areas. The depth of knowledge is dictated by the care needs of each population group, and can be complemented as necessary by the matrix working through focal specialists in more unusual cases.\n\n Multifocal medical specialties aim to promote the provision of comprehensive and transversal care. Examples of multifocal specialties include: acupuncture; clinical medicine; gynecology and obstetrics; emergency medicine; occupational medicine; traffic medicine; sports medicine; physical medicine and rehabilitation; intensive care medicine; forensic and legal medicine; preventive and social medicine; pediatrics; health administration; burn care; adolescent medicine; sleep medicine; fetal medicine; palliative medicine; and family and community medicine.\n\n Situations such as emergencies, admissions to an intensive care unit, or surgery, where mul-tifocal specialists need to have a wide range of information at hand for decision-making, and which often have interfaces with other areas of focal specialties, are common.\n\n The conflict generated by this technological barrier, where knowledge or information is no longer a scarce resource in health settings, but rather available in abundance, leads to another dilemma between care model, which is economic.\n\n Focal care provided in isolated points of delivery historically resulted in a gap between demand for health services and service delivery for the majority of focal specialties, because in high complexity situations access to information tools were not available, meaning that the flow of information in the system was slow and ineffective in the majority of cases.\n\n This economic model strengthens fee-forservice since access to health information for clinical decision-making can only be obtained via consultation or report issued by a focal specialist. This not only results in extremely high-value costs in terms of labor, but also strangles demand by fragmenting care and demand an increasing number of professionals.\n\n By prioritizing service provision by various multifocal professionals supported by one focal specialist under a new knowledge management paradigm, it is possible avoid fragmentation and ensure the delivery of value-based, comprehensive care.\n\n Brazil's national health service has historically been built around a hierarchical, hospital-centric health system. However, the epidemiological transition experienced by the country and major changes in SUS funding arrangements have demanded a more efficient and sustainable model.\n\n Through improved access to information and increased interactivity, the knowledge age has unlocked new horizons of possibilities for developing new models of healthcare management that meet this challenge.\n\n Care coordination has emerged as an alternative approach to hospital care, promoting the integration of various specialties and focusing on knowledge management 26 and the provision of cross-cutting services to provide more effective responses to the challenges of our time.\n\n These challenges require active and dynamic coordination between the different points of delivery that make up the health system where technical knowledge plays a pivotal in promoting the transformation of structural capital and ensuring the provision of quality value-based care 27 .\n\n FHP Uzuelli worked on the design, methodology and final writing; ACD Costa worked in writing and research; B Guedes, CF Wise and SRR Batista worked in methodology.", "qa": [["49_195796440_2_1", "What are some of the barriers to the shift towards a care coordination approach in medical education and training?\n", "Some of the barriers to the shift towards a care coordination approach in medical education and training include a limited understanding of the model among professionals, a focus on the fragmentation of care and super-specialization, and a lack of necessary competences, skills, attitudes, values, and emotional structure.

Cell injury and aberrantly sustained production of cytokines, growth factors, and angiogenic factors in SSc result in a deregulated tissue repair. These deregulated repairs in a tissue tilt its homeostasis toward hyperplasia and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). 1 Excessive deposition of ECM components in tissues of an organ leads to fibrosis which destroys the operations of the organ. 1 Due to the importance of ECM in the maintenance of organ function, regulation of its homeostasis is strictly critical. Studies emphasize that MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors represent a fundamental effect in this maintenance and their alterations can play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. 2 Additionally, MMPs have a significant task in immunity and repair particularly in the procedures like cell migration, leukocyte activation, antimicrobial defense, and chemokine processing. 17 As stated previously, the general function of MMPs is the degradation of the ECM proteins. It is argued that this functionality diminishes in fibrotic organs; however, considering the other operations of MMPs, this notion may be inaccurate. 18 Accordingly, animal models and in vitro studies indicate pro and anti-fibrotic effects for MMPs. MMP3 and MMP7 in the mouse model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) show pro-fibrotic function. Overproduction of MMP3 leads to fibrosis, as a result, bleomycin-induced fibrosis was dramatically reduced in MMP3-/-and MMP7\u2212/\u2212 mice. 19, 20 Over expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was confirmed in IPF patients, their expressions were seen in myofibroblasts, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. 21, 22 Also, alveolar macrophages of these patients expressed excessive amounts of MMP9 which was reduced by immunosuppressive therapy. 23 The increment of gelatinases causes the disruption of the basement membrane and the invasion of fibroblast to the alveolar spaces which in turn benefits the fibrotic process. 21, 22 In\n\n SSc patients with interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) amount and activity of MMP9 is increased in bronchoalveolar lavages compared with bronchoalveolar lavages of SSc patients without ILD and healthy controls.", "qa": [["15_147705007_2_1", "How do MMPs play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases like systemic sclerosis?\n", "MMPs, or matrix metalloproteinases, have a significant role in the maintenance of organ function and the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis.

In the lungs, bleomycin administration significantly induces the expression of MMP9 bands in zymograms, indicating increased activity.

This effect on surfactant, previously referred to as activation (13), did not occur after ventilation with 20 ml/kg. The larger residual volume at 0 cmH 2 O on the deflation pressure-volume curve for the VT20 lambs probably is explained by tissue stretch that is not reversible (24) .

Ingimarsson et al. (14) demonstrated that six breaths with tidal volumes of 35-40 ml/kg resulted in lung injury in preterm lambs. This result would be anticipated, because the unventilated fetal lung with a high fluid volume would not have time to recruit volumes that approach the maximal lung volumes of \u03f350 ml/kg that we measured after 6 h of ventilation. Carlton et al. (5) found that tidal volumes of \u03f350 ml/kg resulted in increased lung microvascular permeability after 4-8 h of mechanical ventilation of full-term lambs, and Hernandez et al. (9) reported that the increased microvascular permeability was prevented by binding the chest. At 15 min the preterm lambs reported here had FRC values of 30 ml/kg, and addition of the 20 ml/kg tidal volume yielded maximal lung volumes at end inspiration of \u03f350 ml/kg, which are the same volumes measured as maximal lung volumes at 6 h. Therefore, the injury resulting from the 20 ml/kg tidal volume is consistent with the concept of lung injury resulting from ventilation to volumes that approach or exceed maximal lung volumes (6) and extends the results of Dreyfuss and Saumon (6) to the preterm lung not treated at birth with surfactant. However, maximal lung volumes probably were smaller in the period immediately after birth when the lung had not been expanded and remained partially fluid filled. The more subtle indications of some injury in the lambs ventilated with 10 ml/kg (somewhat higher alveolar protein and less activation of the largeaggregate surfactant) are consistent with that idea.\n\n Nilsson et al.", "qa": [["40_6614546_6_1", "What are the effects of ventilation with different tidal volumes on preterm lambs?\n", "Ventilation with a tidal volume of 20 ml/kg without surfactant treatment for 30 minutes resulted in lower compliances, lower VEI values, higher alveolar protein, and more loss of surfactant-associated DPC from the alveolar lavages and lungs compared to lambs initially ventilated with a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg.

In phase 2 there was a significant improvement (figure 4) with only nine patients not hearing what the doctor said (Chi square p=0.0016). In phase 2, 20 patients in phase 2 had informed the doctor of a hearing diYculty and 18 patients made use of the amplifier. There was no significant diVerence between phases 1 and 2 in patients knowing what their diagnosis was or wanting the doctor to discuss diagnosis with their family (table 3) . However, in phase 2, there was an improvement in patient understanding of why they were taking their tablets (Chi square p=0.004), although 34 patients in phase 2 still did not know why they took their tablets. Prior to admission 27 patients (phase 1) and 21 (phase 2) used hearing aids. Only 24 patients (phase 1) and 19 patients (phase 2) had brought their hearing aids into hospital, and of these, five (phase 1) and three (phase 2) were non-functioning.\n\n Several studies have indicated that approximately 25% of people between 65 years and 74 years of age, and almost 50% of those 75 years of age or older, experience hearing diYculties. 2 5 Age-related presbyacusis is a complex disorder involving loss of speech processing and discrimination as well as perception of pure tones. Many patients with presbyacusis will benefit from amplification of sound. Whilst some older patients will have sought help from hearing aids prior to hospital admission some will not 6 and some patients will not have their hearing aid in hospital.\n\n Inability to hear what is being said leads to dissatisfaction and the feeling that communication with medical staV could be improved (table 2) . Communication with the nursing staV was initially significantly more satisfactory than with doctors (table 1) . This may reflect the increased time that nursing staV spend with the patients, although it is also possible that the nursing staV had taken the time and eVort to establish the patient's ability to hear. In addition it is possible that doctors use 'medical jargon' more frequently than nursing staV, contributing to communication diYculties.\n\n In phase 2, with the use of voice amplifiers and acetate cards, more patients reported being able to hear the doctor and not surprisingly communication with the doctor was felt to be significantly better than in phase 1 with fewer patients thinking that communication could be improved (table 2) . Unfortunately, there was no significant improvement in patients understanding what was said when the doctor spoke, or knowing what the diagnosis was. Moreover, many patients felt they had learnt most about their diagnosis and treatment from people other than the doctor ( figure 3 ). This suggests that there is a lot of room for improvement and perhaps the introduction of written explanations for some conditions maybe helpful. There was a significant improvement in patients understanding why they were taking their tablets but even so 34 patients in phase 2 did not know why they were taking them. For older patients, who are more likely to have multiple pathologies and therefore taking several drugs, this is a particular problem. It is impossible to entirely exclude the possibility that the perceived improvement in communication in phase 2 was due to the medical staV making more time and eVort in their communication, independent of the voice amplifiers. The contribution is, however, likely to be small. First, the medical staV on the two wards were blind to the phase 2 audit being completed. Second, these are very busy acute wards and medical staV had the same workload in both phases; they are therefore unlikely to have been able to spend more time with their patients.\n\n Doctors working with older patients should be aware of the high prevalence of presbyacusis and specifically enquire whether patients can hear, as not all patients will volunteer that they have problems hearing. Identification of such patients using a sign above their beds (provided they have no objection) will be useful for all hospital staV, and voice amplifiers should be readily available to facilitate communication where such a problem is identified. Most complaints by patients about doctors deal with problems of communication. 7 The commonest complaint is that doctors do not listen to them. 8 Although most patients in this study (158) felt that they had been given suYcient time to talk to the doctor, some (42) felt that they had not. With the increasing workload on hospital doctors and no increase in resources it is diYcult to see how this issue can be adequately addressed. It might be useful for doctors to try and ensure that at the end of every communication with the patient they routinely ask if the patient has any questions. In this study less than 50% of patients had been asked (table 2) . Most but not all patients would like the doctor to discuss their diagnosis with their family (table 3) . Doctors should not assume that they have their patient's permission to talk to their family but directly enquire with the patient whether they have permission. Not all patients and their relatives have the same opinion on information and treatment. 9 This study has shown that simple measures can improve the number of older patients hearing what the doctor says, their perception 10 In order to learn, however, doctors need to be aware that there is a problem and therefore a need to improve.

Thus, this parameter is used to attempt to represent disease states where the individual's thyroid is either exquisitely sensitive or insensitive to TSH stimulation. At lower values, this parameter reduces the impact of TSH on the Vmax for thyroid iodide uptake as well as the rate constants for T4 and T3 production in the thyroid. However, the USEPA (2017) also states that: \"The coefficient, pTSH, is included\u2026to allow for tuning of the strength of the TSH feedback, but in practice model simulations versus data appear quite adequate with pTSH = 1.\" Concerns about this parameter are two-fold. First, the complexity of the model and various runtime scripts makes it nearly impossible to determine the use of this parameter during some of the model assessment and risk assessment simulations presented in USEPA (2017). Second, using point estimate population level data to define the quantitative temporal relationship between two fundamentally linked processes at the individual level is scientifically inappropriate. To understand the biological feedback within a single individual (i.e. to determine the relationship of TSH to T3/T4 and Vmax for a hypothyroid or hyperthyroid individual), matched samples would be needed for TSH, T3 and T4. This information -to our knowledge -is not available from NHANES. Thus, the epidemiological point estimate data are being used Fig. 4 .

However, the use of a T4 production rate that is lower than the published value is not adequately justified, given the importance of this parameter, which has a direct impact on predictions of fT4 changes, the intended application of the model. This baseline value is then scaled in pregnancy through GW 16 (peak occurring \u223c GW 9) based upon placental hCG increase over this time, according to the linear relationship from Glinoer (1997) : hCGreg = 1 + 0.00354 \u00d7 hCG.\n\n The model uses a Km for perchlorate binding to the NIS (KmNIS_P) that is 3-fold lower than the value estimated by Lumen et al.

In a recent meta-analysis by Liu et al, 3 20 population-based studies published between 2000 and 2013 were reviewed. The pooled worldwide prevalence of pterygium was found to be 10.2%, 3 with prevalence rates ranging from 2.8% in a study by Wu et al 4 and 33% in a study by McCarty et al. 5 The prevalence of pterygium in men was also higher than that in women, with rates of 14.5% and 13.6%, respectively. 3 Pterygium was more prevalent with increasing age up to 69 years.\n\n Populations living in geographic latitudes ranging from 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 also had a higher prevalence of pterygium compared with any other area. 3 The nasal limbus is the most common site for pterygium formation. This predilection has been attributed to the focusing of light passing through the anterior chamber at the nasal limbus, causing damage to the limbal stem cells and inducing oxidative stress. 6, 7 Many population-based studies have also revealed an association between pterygium formation and outdoor occupation and activities, most likely a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the pathogenesis of which has been described. 8, 9 Conjunctival UV autofluorescence, a biomarker of ocular exposure to UV light, has been shown to be higher in individuals with pterygium than those without. 10 An increase in prevalence has also been noted in rural populations when compared to urban populations, likely reflecting differences in lifestyle and lifetime exposure to UV radiation. 3, 11, 12 Many tumor-like features, including the propensity to invade normal tissue, the high rate of recurrence, and the coexistence with premalignant lesions, challenge the idea that pterygia are benign lesions. 6 In one study, including 100 cases of pterygia, concurrent ocular surface disease included five cases of ocular surface squamous neoplasia, six cases of primary acquired melanosis, and two compound nevi (one of which was suspicious for melanoma). 6 It is thus recommended that all pterygia be sent for histopathology to rule out concurrent ocular surface disorders, including those with malignant potential. 6 \n\n The treatment of pterygia is surgical; however, because of the high rate of recurrence, careful consideration of the risks and benefits for surgery is necessary before primary excision is undertaken. Indications for treatment include any one or more of the following: vision loss secondary to astigmatism or progressive encroachment on the visual axis, restriction of ocular movement, or discomfort and irritation. 13 Current management options for pterygium include excision, conjunctival autografting, and the use of adjuvant therapies including mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, and \u03b2-irradiation.\n\n The technique of excising a pterygium without repairing the remaining defect is called bare sclera excision. This technique is no longer recommended because of its high rate of recurrence, which ranges from 38% to 88%.\n\n 14 This recurrence rate is higher than for any other treatment modality. 13 Moreover, there are no advantages conferred by this technique except for its simplicity and short surgical time. 13 Primary closure is a technique that involves excision of the pterygium, followed by suturing of the remaining conjunctiva on either side of the wound over the bare sclera, to close the defect. This procedure has also been reported to have an unacceptably high rate of recurrence compared to newer techniques (45%-70%). 14 Given the unacceptable recurrence rates of both bare sclera and primary closure techniques, advances in pterygium excision have focused on the use of grafts and adjuvant therapies, of which conjunctival autografts are the most commonly used.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Alterations of the body temperature of even only few degrees Celsius can have a strong direct or indirect influence on numerous biological processes. For example, morphological and functional changes of membranes and organic molecules induced by a change in temperature of only 28C can alter the activity of enzymes involved in cellular metabolisms. 7 Mild to moderate hypothermia (T \u00bc 328C-358C) can block the cascade of destructive inflammation, prevent blood-aqueous barrier disruption that leads to apoptosis 5 and local edema, and possibly stimulate the release of protective proteins. In addition, other authors reported that reducing the temperature of plasma could kill pathogens, which was used to disinfect wounds, accelerate wound healing, and induce apoptosis of some cancer cells in vitro. 8 The application of mild to moderate hypothermia decreases neurological tissue damage caused by ischemia reperfusion, reduces the oxygen metabolic request, and induces the release of protective proteins. 5 In fact, maintaining body temperature between 328C to 348C is one of the treatment options for ischemic cardiac stroke, neurological injury, and neonatal encephalopathy. In addition, mild to moderate hypothermia is currently applied in cardiothoracic or neurosurgical operations to prevent intraoperative strokes. 1, 2 On the other hand, it has been also reported that deep hypothermia (T , 328C) inhibits platelets and reduce the concentration of thromboxane B2, leading to longer clotting times, electrolyte discrepancy, and arrhythmias. 3, 6 In ophthalmology, animal studies in albino rats have demonstrated the protective effects of inducing local hypothermia in vitrectomy under fluctuating intraocular pressure: it reduces stromal edema of the ciliary body and inhibits blood-aqueous barrier disruption. 9 Clinical studies have been performed by our group and others to measure the intraocular temperature in human eyes undergoing vitrectomy, showing significant fluctuations at different times of the surgical process. [10] [11] [12] Landers et al. 10 reported that the mean midvitreous and retina temperature in six eyes before vitrectomy with closed infusion line was 34.88C and 35.28C, respectively. The authors also reported that the temperature inside the vitreous cavity reached to deep hypothermia and quickly increased after closing the infusion fluid.\n\n Romano et al. 12 recently investigated the changes of mean vitreous temperature during the vitreoretinal procedures. Temperature was recorded with a 23-gauge thermoprobe in the anterior chamber and on the retinal surface at one time point, whereas the temperature in the vitreous cavity was measured during the entire surgical procedure under fluid infusion and air infusion. At baseline, the temperature was 33.68C 6 1.4, and it reached to 26.88C 6 1.0 at the beginning of vitrectomy and 24.88C 6 0.8 at the end of the surgery under fluid infusion. The temperature fluctuations in different phases of vitreoretinal surgery were statistically significant.\n\n Moreover, variations in intraocular temperature induce changes the surface tension (ST) and shear viscosity (SV) of the endotamponades commonly used during vitreoretinal surgery (i.e., silicone oil [SO] and perfluorcarbon liquid [PFCL] ). For example, despite meticulous removal, small amount of PFCL is often found in the vitreous cavity after vitreoretinal surgery due to fluid-air exchange. 13 The PFCL left on the retina can cause inflammation, emulsification, and sticky oil formation. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The viscosity of PCFL plays a basic role when removing PCFL from eyes; therefore, this process can be improved by modulating the intraocular temperature.\n\n Based on the reported biological damage induced by variation of the temperature and on changes induced by temperature on the intraocular compounds, the aim of our study was to describe the best use of the temperature to perform a safer surgical procedures and the best pressure-temperature balance to manage the endotamponades.\n\n \n\n The dynamic changes of temperature are caused by the balance between the inflow and outflow of the fluid in the vitreous cavity.

The final definition of glucose tolerance was based on the mean of the two OGTTs (314 NGT, 192 IGT and 174 NIDDM subjects [27] ). All participants gave their informed consent for these studies, which were approved by the local ethics committee.\n\n Methods. Blood pressure, weight and height were measured and body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated as previously described [26] . Information on smoking habits and protein intake was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. We measured fasting and 2-h post-load venous plasma glucose levels, HbA 1c , fasting plasma levels of insulin (with a specific assay) and proinsulin, and fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, as described in detail elsewhere [26, 28] . Fasting proinsulin levels were not measured in previously diagnosed NIDDM (n = 67). The Friedewald formula was used to calculate the LDL cholesterol concentration, except when serum triglyceride was greater than 8.0 mmol/l (n = 3) [29] .\n\n An early morning first voided spot urine sample was collected. The presence of leukocytes was tested by microscopy and scored as positive ( > 5 leukocytes per high powerfield) or negative. Urinary albumin was measured by rate nephelometry (Array Protein System, Beckman, Galway, Ireland) with a threshold of 6.2 mg/l and intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 5 % and 8 %, respectively. Urinary creatinine was measured by a modified Jaff\u00d8 method. The urinary albuminto-creatinine ratio (ACR) was calculated; ACR K 2.0 mg/ mmol was defined as normoalbuminuria and ACR above 2.0 mg/mmol as microalbuminuria. (An overnight ACR > 2.0 mg/mmol predicts an albumin excretion rate > 30 mg/min with a high sensitivity and specificity [30] .) The reproducibility of the ACR was calculated from a representative sample of 185 subjects who collected a second urine sample in similar fashion. The Kappa coefficient of the ACRs in these subjects was 0.59, indicating moderate agreement [31] . The analyses were performed on 622 subjects of the initial 680; 24 urine samples were lost and 34 subjects used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and were therefore excluded. For 174 subjects the ACR was based on the mean of two measurements. Six subjects had an ACR above 30 mg/mmol, a level which approximates an albumin excretion of 300 mg/24 h, i. e. the upper limit for microalbuminuria. Excluding these subjects from the analyses did not materially affect any of the results, which are therefore presented for the entire group.\n\n Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). We postulated that if MA was part of the IRS, MA should be related not only to hypertension and NIDDM (of which MA may be a complication, as suggested by the alternative hypothesis described above), but also to dyslipidaemia, central obesity and hyperinsulinaemia or IR. Therefore, multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between the presence of MA and IRS-related variables. The Wald test was used to test significance. All odds ratios for MA were adjusted for age, sex and glucose tolerance. We used three different models, in which each separate variable was adjusted for the other IRS-related variables. In the first, we considered, as IRS-related variables, fasting hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance (i. e. IGT or NIDDM), hypertension and WHR [32, 33] . In the second, fasting hyperinsulinaemia was replaced by IR, according to the formula of the homeostasis model assessment: IR = fasting insulin\u00b4fasting glucose / 22.4 [34] .", "qa": [["5_10161671_1_1", "What are the risk factors associated with microalbuminuria?\n", "Microalbuminuria is associated with several risk factors, including hypertension, NIDDM (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), dyslipidemia, central obesity, and hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance.

[The program] is helping us so that my next generation will be free from these diseases. '\n\n Family members also commented on an improvement of attitudes towards patients who were previously stigmatized. A 45 year old businessman mentioned that 'Previously people disliked lymphedema patients but now there is no discrimination, people are aware through television, radio about the disease.'\n\n Even so, several males felt that their family members' lymphedema could still be used as a target during quarrels, but few examples of discrimination were listed. A 70 year old female family member claimed 'During fever with vomiting people feel very unclean about [accepting Lymphedema patients].\n\n Community members in general insisted that discrimination against lymphedema patients did not exist and all the participants in one male focus group concurred:\n\n 'There is no restriction for them to participate in any village function, they worship with us in the same temple, we bathe in a common pond'.\n\n Gender and marriage issues. While most of the focus groups denied significant differences between how patients of different genders experience lymphedema, the issue of marriageability was an area where differences in gender were noted. For example, a 33 year old female family member claimed:\n\n 'Marriage is difficult for a girl if she is a patient. But in case of men sometime it's possible.'\n\n The concern regarding marriageability among female patients involved not only the possibility of finding a groom, but also the ability to marry someone of suitable social status. A 45 year old male farmer (unilateral, stage 2) noted 'For a young girl with LF it is very difficult to get married.'\n\n In addition, a 60 year old retired male teacher (community member) stated, 'It's difficult to find a groom for a girl [patient] in the same status.'\n\n Issues remained for lymphedema patients who were already married, as demonstrated by two female patients who described having to leave their husbands after their in-laws had found out about their illness. Four other women who discussed their own marriages claimed that their in-laws and/or husbands had been supportive. One 45 year old housewife (bilateral, stage 2) had a more mixed experience, explaining:\n\n 'My relationship with my husband is good but after the disease the relationship with my inlaws has not been good.'\n\n The roles of mothers with lymphedema were not directly explored, but one male family member stated that his children's studies were affected by his wife's lymphedema and another male stated:\n\n 'My mother is a patient so we face a lot of problems. If mother is healthy then the entire family is healthy.'\n\n \n\n These focus groups demonstrated that a basic understanding of LF infection and disease can co-exist with alternative local explanations. Our study adds to previous work from India that demonstrated similar local understandings of causes of LF and lymphedema, [29] specifically diet, hard labor in the field, and heredity. As there are gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of filarial lymphedema, it is recognized that immunologic and genetic factors have been implicated in addition to environmental and demographic characteristics. [30] Nevertheless, in other research from India, the study population had not been exposed to education on LF and therefore only 9-20% of respondents identified mosquitoes as the vectors of infection, whereas in this study, we found that in all focus groups there was mention of the mosquito vector. [29] This acceptance of multiple explanations of disease, or cognitive dissonance, is not unique. A study of patients in a rural hospital in South Africa revealed that although most patients held traditional beliefs about illness and treatment, they were accepting of the hospital's 'biomedical healthcare' and believed the two systems could co-exist. Nurses' acceptance of these beliefs enabled patients to feel comfortable navigating the two systems and reaching compromises. [31] Similar observance of traditional beliefs while continuing to access biomedical care has been observed in antenatal care patients in Zambia and Swaziland.

It affects up to 3% of individuals of AngloSaxon origin over the age of 40 years but is rare in Arabs. Although most patients are asymptomatic, a variety of symptoms and complications may develop directly from bone involvement or secondarily to compression by bone expansion and increased blood flow. The disease can be treated by using medications that inhibit bone resorption, such as calcitonin and the bisphosphonates. Here we describe the case of an Omani patient with the disease, involving the skull, spine, pelvis, and tibia. He presented to the endocrine clinic in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with a six-year history of headache, bone pain, progressive skull enlargement, and left-sided deafness. His alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 1500 U/L. His disease responded gradually to six months of subcutaneous and nasal calcitonin followed by a single 5 mg intravenous injection of zoledronic acid. This resulted in a further progressive reduction of his bone pain, skull size, and improvement in his hearing, as well as normalization of his serum ALP levels after one-year. This effect has been sustained for 3 years.\n\n Omayma Elshafie, et al. The skull X-ray showed thick bones and the \"cotton wool\" spots that characterize the osteoblast response [ Figure 1 ]. The bone scan showed the involvement of skull, ribs, cervical spine, and tibia with an isotopic skull:femoral ratio of 34% [ Figure 2 ]. The clinical, biochemical, and radiological findings were diagnostic of active Paget's disease. The patient was unaware of any similarly affected family member.\n\n Initially, we started him on subcutaneous calcitonin daily for six months. During this time his bone pain improved, and there was a small fall in ALP levels. This was followed by a single 5 mg intravenous injection of zoledronic acid. This resulted in a gradual reduction of serum ALP from 1500 U/L to 112 U/L [ Figure 3 ], and normalization of osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline levels [ Table 1 ] over an 18 month period with a considerable improvement in his clinical symptoms. There was a reduction in head size, indicated by the size of his Kuma (an Omani hat). A repeat bone scan revealed a marked reduction of the skull:femur ratio from 34% to 4% [ Figure 4 ]. Currently, his response to treatment is Figure 1 : The skull X-ray showed thick bones and the \"cotton wool\" spots that characterize the osteoblastic response.\n\n A technetium-99m hydroxy diphosphonate bone scan before treatment showed increased uptake in the affected areas; the skull, spine, pelvis, and the right tibia. Uptake in the skull was high (97%) compared to the left femur (3%) with a ratio of 34%.\n\n being monitored with serial ALP measurement. If these increase, a further infusion of zoledronic acid will be given. He was also given calcium and vitamin D3 two weeks before starting treatment to exclude the possibility of associated vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia.\n\n Paget's disease of bone is a localized bone remodeling disorder of uncertain etiolog y, 10 although environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved. In the UK, mutations of the sequestosome 1 gene (SQSTM1) are found in approximately 11% of affected individuals. Patients with mutations present at an earlier age and have more affected bones than those without mutations. Currently, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research do not recommend routine genetic testing. 11 Paget's disease is not new and was found in 1000-year-old Anglo-Saxon skeletal remains. 12 Both men and women are affected with slight male preponderance. The bone that is remodeled by this pathological process becomes enlarged and mechanically weakened. A stretched periosteum produces bone pain by enlargement of the bone or by increased pressure on the medulla due to increased blood flow in the diseased bone. 3 This bone expansion will cause skeletal deformity, fractures, and various neurological compression syndromes. However, most patients with Paget's disease are asymptomatic and discovered because of increased serum ALP or as an incidental X-ray finding. 13 This disorder is most unusual in the Arab world, 4, 5 which explains why the diagnosis is often delayed. Affected individuals are often thought to have bone tumors or osteomyelitis. We elected to treat this patient due to the presence of the following: bone pain, extensive skull involvement, tinnitus, and unsteadiness of gait. Prophylactic treatment may be indicated in several situations including preparation for orthopedic procedures and vertebral body involvement to prevent neurologic compression syndromes. 14 The patient was started on calcitonin initially as this drug directly inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone pain, which is possibly due to the fall in bone blood flow. 15, 16 Using calcitonin for three to six months before giving the patient bisphosphonate will allow bone remodeling and normal lamellar bone formation. 17, 18 A good example of this was seen in a treated Saudi Bedouin patient, where healing of the V-shaped bony defects and the cortical bone remodeling during treatment with calcitonin occurred. 4 The use of bisphosphonates alone can produce healing of lytic lesions on radiographs, but they do not induce bone remodeling. 19 Calcitonin treatment is infrequently used in the management of Paget's disease. However, our experience indicates that it will improve bone remodeling with obvious radiological improvement in juvenile 20 and adult Paget's disease. 4 Furthermore, normal lamellar bone is laid down during treatment. 18 For this reason, we usually give a short course of calcitonin before starting bisphosphonate treatment particularly when affected areas of the bone are likely to cause problems and need strengthening.\n\n After six months of calcitonin treatment to achieve cortical bone healing, the patient received a 5 mg intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid. There was further progressive clinical and biochemical improvement and after one year his serum ALP and bone turnover markers became normal. This effect has persisted for 3 years, to date. Zoledronic acid was chosen as it proved to be more effective in Paget's disease than the other available bisphosphonates. 19 \n\n Patients with Paget's disease requiring treatment should receive calcitonin initially to reduce bone turnover and allow normal bone remodeling before starting treatment with a bisphosphonate.\n\n The authors declared no conflicts of interest.\n\n r efer ences", "qa": [["42_20328988_0_1", "What are the common symptoms and complications associated with Paget's disease of bone?", "Paget's disease of bone can present with a variety of symptoms and complications.

However, the quality of this study was poor and had many limitations. We give some value to false beliefs and their relationship with self-efficacy improvements, considering that this fact seems to be important for the patient's recovery.\n\n Intermediate-term improvements were found in headache disability when patients were treated with TPE. Disabilities associated with migraines are strictly related to its severity. Some areas remain functioning, such as communication, mobility, self-care, society activities, or relationships, whereas others are particularly affected [64] . An avoidance-based lifestyle may be extremely stressful, and this stress may produce chronic migraines and disability [65] .\n\n In this work, three of the studies examined at intermediate term were high-quality studies and showed the most significant results of TPE in reducing disability in patients with migraines [36, 38] . Besides TPE, other interventions, such as physical therapy [66, 67] or peripheral nerve stimulation, are also able to reduce disability in those complex treatment patients [68, 69] . In this way, some authors suggest that earlier tertiary-level intervention may avoid the complications of migraine that occur in some patients and the increasing costs and utilization of care associated with higher disability [70] .\n\n Differences in the reduction of headache frequency in the intermediate term have been demonstrated. A good quality study by Bromberg et al. presented the most significant results at the intermediate term [38] .\n\n Headache frequency is the main issue for migraine patients and is strongly associated with increasing disability. Therefore, it is known that the combination of TPE and beta-blockers yield greater reduction in the frequency of headaches and days with headaches [37] . It is possible that group interventions, as proposed by Lemstra et al., may be useful for patients as people tend to mirror themselves on the others improving headache frequency, intensity and duration, quality of life, pain related disability, and depressive symptoms [36] .\n\n It is clear that improvements in disability, quality of life, and frequency of headaches were occurred in the intermediate term, but not in the short term. It might be too ambitious to aim for a significant decrease in these factors immediately after the TPE due to the participants, as they may still be in the process of learning to adapt their lifestyle. According to the process of learning and memory, necessary time is required to consolidate the information received. The studies of Fuster and Alexander (published from 1971 and later) support the idea of memory consolidating in the intermediate/long term [71, 72] .\n\n It is worth noting that this is the first meta-analysis that collected information about the clinical effectiveness of TPE for migraine and chronic migraine patients.\n\n This study has several limitations. First, our meta-analysis did not have enough data to make long-term statistical evaluations. Second, only eight of 14 studies showed acceptable methodological quality, whereas the other six papers had five points on the Delphi scale. It must be noted that two of the nine articles selected for the metaanalysis obtained low methodological quality scores, which may have distorted the results from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Third, the research in PsychINFO database could lead to bias because retrieves unpublished dissertations from North America and excludes the rest of dissertations.\n\n Additionally, there is a lack of information from gray literature, which was not examined, and includes Conference Papers Index, Dissertation Abstracts, or System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe. Fourth, the blinded intervention status was not considered to be possible in some studies, and it is possible that there were variations in the results due to special attention and interest received by different groups (known as Hawthorne effect). Undoubtedly, the use of blinding processes is of great importance in the development of high-quality clinical trials. Indeed, not using this system may result in certain studies not reaching a sufficient level of evaluation quality. However, currently, there is much controversy on this topic between different researchers in the field of psychology. When viewed from a behavioral point of view, some authors say that it is not necessary to blind patients or therapists because they are actively involved in the acquisition of skills and not just passive. Although it looks complicated, it might be interesting that some quality studies focus their goal in the improvement of blinding strategies in those disciplines. Moreover, the fact that patients were volunteers in a few of the studies could lead to bias. However, according to Rains et al., the use of TPE for headache is mostly either infeasible or simply not possible; only rarely is blinding meaningfully achievable in administration of BBT [73] .", "qa": [["29_18600147_6_1", "What are some interventions other than TPE that can reduce disability in patients with migraines?\n", "Besides TPE, other interventions such as physical therapy or peripheral nerve stimulation have shown effectiveness in reducing disability in patients with migraines.
