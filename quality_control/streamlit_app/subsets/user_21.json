Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Of the nearly 30 million operations in the United States each year, more than 2% are complicated by an SSI. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher in patients in whom an SSI develops compared with uninfected patients, and hospital readmission rates are significantly increased. [6] [7] [8] Surgical site infections increase length of stay by an average of 7 days and charges by approximately $3000. 6, 9 When an SSI is diagnosed after hospital discharge, outpatient and emergency department visits, use of radiology services, hospital readmissions, and use of home health care services increase significantly, as do total health care costs. 10 The attributable costs of an SSI may be more than $30000 for patients undergoing cardiac or orthopedic operations. [11] [12] [13] [14] The effectiveness of antimicrobials administered shortly before skin incision for prevention of SSIs was established in the 1960s and has been repeatedly demonstrated since.

Previous studies have demonstrated inappropriate timing of antimicrobial administration, inappropriate selection of the antimicrobial agent, and excess duration of prophylaxis. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] In a 1996 study of patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, hip replacement, or largebowel resection in 44 hospitals in New York State, Silver and colleagues 30 demonstrated that 14% did not receive antimicrobial prophylaxis, and only 63% of those who received antimicrobials had them administered in the 2 hours before incision.\n\n In 2002, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, implemented the National Surgical Infection Prevention Project.

According to current knowledge, endotoxin is characterized as the main inflammatory factor in occupational environments [1] . The inhaled endotoxin has a causative role in the acute bronchial obstruction, which can be measured by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ). The change in FEV 1 is usually measured before and after workshift and is presented as the \"across-shift \u0394FEV 1 \" [2] .\n\n according to the phase of the treatment process where they worked: -mechanical treatment workers (MTW), -biological treatment workers (BTW), -sewage sludge treatment workers (SSTW), -operation control workers (OCW), -administrative workers (ADW). The study covered all workers in the plant who had worked morning shift from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. during measurement period. All included participants were men. Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . On average, subjects were 43 years old and worked for 8.5 years in this sewage plant.\n\n Total airborne dust for endotoxin assessment was collected with the use of personal Apex pumps (Casella, Ltd., UK) and 7-hole inhalable aerosol samplers (Casella, Ltd., UK) with 25 mm glass fiber (GF/F) filters (Whatman, Poland). The sampling time was 6 h with a calibrated air flow of 2 l/min. Measurements were conducted every Monday from the beginning of June through July. In each subject 1 measurement was carried out. After each sampling day, the filters were placed into sterilized cassette containers and stored frozen Endotoxin-related pulmonary function changes have been shown in experimental studies [3] as well as in a number of field studies. They covered various occupational groups such as: cotton workers [4] , poultry workers [5] , animal feed and grain workers [6] and potato processing workers [7] . Unfortunately, similar studies in sewage treatment plants are still insufficient. Exposure to endotoxin has been also assessed in this branch, however, the analysis was focused on evaluation of the relationship with workers' health symptoms, mainly from the respiratory tract [8, 9] . In the newest study, Heldal et al. [10] tried to assess across-shift changes of lung function according to endotoxin exposure among sewage workers; however, no relationship was found. All these facts show that there is still a need to carry out in-depth study of this phenomenon among sewage workers. The aim of this work was to assess endotoxin exposure among sewage treatment plant workers and its effect on short-term changes in respiratory airflow.\n\n Population under study A group of 78 sewage treatment plant workers (STPW) was studied in the Combined Sewage Treatment Plant in Central Poland. Workers were divided into 5 subgroups \n\n For endotoxin and inhalable dust concentrations, the arithmetic (AM) and geometric mean (GM) were calculated as the measure of central tendency, while geometric standard deviation (GSD) was used as indicator of variation. Normality of the distributions of exposure variables were tested by Shapiro-Wilk statistic. Concentration values of endotoxin and inhalable dust were log-transformed for regression analysis.\n\n The evaluation of the changes in the spirometry parameters during a working shift was performed with the use of a linear regression model, in which the morning measure results were included as a predictor variable. In this way, the influence of the parameters that were constant during the work shift and affected the spirometry results was eliminated. We adjusted for strong predictors even if they were not confounders to gain some precision in standard errors of estimates [12] . The parameters describing the exposure during a work shift (endotoxins, inhalable dust and smoking status) were examined individually in a univariate linear regression model. A multifactor model was created to account for parameters significantly correlated with the spirometric variables. All statistics were calculated by R software package (Free Software Foundation, USA). For statistical inference, a p < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n \n\n Detailed results of inhalable dust and endotoxin exposure among STPW are presented in Table 2 . ).\n\n The spirometry was performed using a portable spirometer Spirolab II (MIR, Italy), which has digital turbine flow sensor that required no calibration and complied with the stringent American Thoracic Society [11] 24/26 waveforms.", "qa": [["16_3154844_0_1", "What are some of the agents found in bioaerosols that can cause inflammation or lung function changes?\n", "Bioaerosols can contain agents such as endotoxin, allergens, mycotoxins, and (1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-glucans, which can cause inflammation or changes in lung function."], ["16_3154844_0_2", "How is the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured in relation to occupational exposure to endotoxin?\n", "The change in FEV1 is usually measured before and after a workshift and is presented as the \"across-shift \u0394FEV1.\" A decrease in FEV1 after exposure to endotoxin indicates acute bronchial obstruction."], ["16_3154844_0_3", "What are some occupational groups that have been studied in relation to endotoxin exposure and pulmonary function changes?\n", "Various occupational groups, such as cotton workers, poultry workers, animal feed and grain workers, and potato processing workers, have been studied in relation to endotoxin exposure and pulmonary function changes.

[211] RCTs are required to evaluate the efficacy of EPO in TBI treatment.\n\n Scientific evidence accumulated during the past decades on TBI pathophysiology and therapy supports the development of multimodal drugs for TBI treatment. It is assumed that all drugs targeting a single TBI pathological factor failed till now probably because the pathogenesis of TBI involves multiple cellular and molecular processes. Therefore, multifunctional drugs acting on several TBI pathophysiological pathways seem to represent a better therapeutic alternative in TBI. Since peptide-mediated mechanisms were found to contribute to most of the processes of secondary brain damage and neurorepair after TBI, multimodal peptidergic drugs may be a good option for the effective treatment of TBI patients.\n\n Preliminary clinical results obtained with the peptidergic drug Cerebrolysin, as well as with the neuropeptides progesterone and EPO, are very promising and support the pertinence of the approach to TBI therapy with multimodal peptidergic agents. Treatment with Cerebrolysin was associated with a faster clinical recovery, a shorter hospitalization time and a better long-term outcome in TBI patients. However, data about the effects of Cerebrolysin on survival after TBI are lacking. Progesterone therapy had some advantages over placebo on TBI mortality and clinical outcome at certain follow-up time points; whereas EPO seems to reduce in-hospital mortality without affecting clinical TBI outcome. All these positive findings still require validation by confirmatory RCTs.\n\n At present, there is no effective drug therapy approved for TBI. Thus, the main priority now is to try to confirm the promising results previously obtained with Cerebrolysin and progesterone in ongoing Phase III RCTs. Important issues to be further addressed in TBI treatment include the improvement of the poor acute outcome in elderly patients, the implementation of the more efficient drug strategies for the prevention, recovery and management of long-term disabilities, and the identification of the most appropriate time windows for therapeutic interventions during acute and postacute TBI phases.

Alcohol misuse is a primary concern for the Department of Defense (DoD) because rates are higher among military personnel than civilians, the economic cost to the DoD is considerable, and alcohol misuse can adversely affect job performance and readiness [6] . High-risk alcohol use has been an ongoing issue for the US military, with the Marine Corps maintaining the highest levels of problematic drinking among the services [7] .\n\n Social ecological frameworks applied to health emphasize the role of not only individual-level variables but also broader environmental, social, and policy factors [8] . Specific to alcohol use, for example, the World Health Organization has recognized the importance of restricting alcohol availability and pricing strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm [9] . Social disorganization theory would predict that broad community disadvantage (e.g., higher crime, greater unemployment, and poor community infrastructure and resources) may promote higher alcohol norms and heavy drinking [10] . Understanding environmental factors related to alcohol use is important, in that combining individual-level change in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with change in the environment, such as availability of alcohol, laws and policies, and community norms, is considered among the strongest of prevention strategies.\n\n Self-report survey studies have examined environmental influences and strategies for reducing alcohol risks in the military to some extent [11] [12] [13] . According to a 2012 study by the Institute of Medicine, military-relevant environmental risk factors, such as ready availability of alcohol on or near bases (often at reduced prices) and boredom on military bases and in deployed settings with few recreational activities available or perceived to be available, may also play a role [14] . In addition, cultural and geographical influences may contribute to alcohol misuse for those deployed in overseas countries [15, 16] . A study of unit-level influences on alcohol and tobacco use found that being stationed overseas, greater reported access to alcohol in barracks, reports of lower enforcement of alcohol control policies in barracks, and perceptions that drinking was the only recreation available were all factors associated with increased alcohol use among military personnel [17] .\n\n The aforementioned studies, while important, were limited in that they generally relied on service members' subjective reports of alcohol misuse and environmental risks. Moreover, they included a limited number of alcohol outcomes and did not examine environmental protective factors. The purpose of the present study was to add to what is known about environmental correlates of alcohol misuse in the US Marine Corps by identifying a large number of objective on-base and surrounding community environmental risk and protective factors that may be associated with several alcohol misuse outcomes and amenable to change. Using an exploratory case study approach, we studied 3 large Marine Corps installations whereby objective base-level aggregated data were collected for 4 alcohol-related outcomes, a wide range of on-base and community environmental risk factors, and several environmental factors thought to potentially protect against or offset alcohol misuse among Marines.\n\n \n\n Pattern matching is a qualitative case study methodology useful for the intensive study of a single case or a small number of cases (i.e., 3 Marine Corps installations in this study) [18] . Using this hypothesis-driven analytical technique, we compared an empirically-based pattern with an expected or hypothesized pattern for multiple outcomes and factors. For example, we hypothesized that a higher rank order of alcohol-related medical diagnoses would correspond to a higher rank order of the risk factor of on-base alcohol availability among the 3 installations. We examined 4 alcohol-related outcome variables and a wide variety of 23 objective environmental factors, which included 13 on-base and 10 off-base sociodemographic and environmental risk and protective factors (Table 1) .\n\n Since the pattern-matching approach relies on expected patterns, we proposed several directional hypotheses based on published studies of individual-level risk factors in civilian and military samples, as well as social ecological theory.", "qa": [["73_51705079_0_1", "What are some of the negative health and social consequences associated with excessive alcohol use?\n", "Excessive alcohol use is associated with a broad range of negative health and social consequences, including productivity loss, legal problems, arrests for driving under the influence (DUI), incarceration, injury and hospitalization, motor vehicle crashes, physical aggression, domestic violence, risky sexual behavior, suicide, addiction, and death."], ["73_51705079_0_2", "How does alcohol misuse affect job performance and readiness in the military?\n", "Alcohol misuse is a primary concern for the Department of Defense (DoD) because rates are higher among military personnel than civilians, the economic cost to the DoD is considerable, and alcohol misuse can adversely affect job performance and readiness.

A chest X-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, confirmed by thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan. He had no other symptoms. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, but his symptoms were thought insufficient to warrant treatment.\n\n In July 2004, he developed numbness and pain behind the right knee which gradually spread to the lower back, right buttock and posterior thigh.

Nerve conduction studies and an electromyogram (EMG) revealed abnormalities in the S1 segment, consistent with an S1 radiculopathy. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (sACE) was persistently normal but an isotope-labelled gallium scan showed increased bilateral lung hilar and lachrymal gland uptake. He developed skin nodules on his right thigh which, when biopsied, were confirmed as erythema nodosum. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered overwhelmingly likely, and in the absence of compression, the involvement of the S1 root was thought most likely due to neurosarcoidosis.

In April 2005, he started methotrexate (up to 12.5 mg per week) because of persistent pain and the need to lower his steroid dose because of his elevated glucose levels.\n\n In November 2005, he developed left peri-orbital and hemicranial headache, followed by diplopia on left gaze. He was found to have a partial left sixth nerve palsy and was re-admitted. MRI showed thickening and gadolinium enhancement in the left cavernous sinus with no parenchymal change.

Serum rheumatoid factor, plasma viscosity, C-reactive protein, urea and electrolytes, liver function, clotting, autoimmune profile, protein electrophoresis, acetylcholine receptor antibodies, anti-neuronal antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies, creatine kinase and ACE were all normal.

His CSF was again entirely normal, including negative oligoclonal band assay. Brain and orbit MRI scanning were normal. EMG and nerve conduction studies suggested improvement of S1 radiculopathy.

The difference in predictive power is potentially due to the approach taken in discovering these signatures. The BD-L metagene was derived from changes in gene expression due to a modest overexpression of BRCA1 within a single cell line. This unbiased approach goes beyond indicating the BRCA1 mutational status or the acute response to a stimulus to provide a measure of BRCA1 pathway function that can include the contribution of BRCA1 and its interacting components. Alternatively, the genes that comprise the BD-L metagene may comprise functional networks that contribute to the observed PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Mapping of the 112 BD-L genes to functional networks using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a predominant network association with biological functions of proliferation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis (Additional file 1). While these functions have not previously been associated with response to PARP inhibitors, the potential for specific aspects of these functions for influencing sensitivity provide possible avenues for future investigation. In conclusion, the BD-L metagene may provide a measure of BRCA1 pathway function as opposed to indicating BRCA1 mutational status, direct expression levels, or response to an acute stimulus.\n\n In summary, we identified a BRCA1 Deficient-Like metagene that is enriched in HER2+ brain metastases when compared with HER2+ primary tumors, and in an independent data set confirmed the enrichment of the metagene in brain metastases as compared to bone metastases, lung metastases, and primary breast tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that high BD-L metagene value is enriched in, but not limited to, primary tumors of BRCA1 mutation carriers and sporadic ER-/HER2-patients. When the BD-L signature is calculated for a breast cancer cell line panel using gene expression from two independent data sets, the BD-L metagene correlates with pharmacologic response to a combination treatment of olaparib and a temozolomide. Lastly, we demonstrated that the BD-L metagene outperforms extant classifiers of BRCA1/2 status in predicting pharmacological response to the drug combination in the breast cancer cell panel.\n\n Since the clinical administration of PARP inhibitors is still in its infancy, there is a crucial need to both identify patients who will gain benefit from this class of drugs and to develop biomarkers that predict clinical response. Currently, BRCA1/2 status is the prevailing indicator of potential PARP inhibitor sensitivity, although not all BRCA1/2 breast cancers respond and there is preclinical evidence to suggest that PARP inhibitors may hold benefit in cancer populations beyond BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [54] . Herein, we provide evidence that the BD-L metagene may be enriched in clinically detectable breast cancer brain metastases and the metagene may implicate sporadic breast cancers across the conventional receptor and mutational status classifications that may benefit from a PARP inhibitor-based therapy while also identifying triple negative and BRCA1-mutant cancers that may prove refractory to treatment.", "qa": [["70_6549184_5_1", "What is the potential significance of the BD-L metagene in predicting response to PARP inhibitors in breast cancer?\n", "The BD-L metagene, derived from changes in gene expression due to overexpression of BRCA1, may provide a measure of BRCA1 pathway function and correlate with pharmacologic response to a combination treatment of olaparib and temozolomide.

The third and sixth scenarios had the same probabilities, the only difference being that the options were inverted; consequently, we expected that whoever chose option \"A\" in the third scenario would choose \"B\" in the sixth and vice versa ( Figure 2 ). The fourth and eighth scenarios contained dominated options and presented the same probabilities in different orders. We expected that the subjects would choose option \"A\" in the fourth and option \"B\" in the last scenario ( Figure 3 ).\n\n We performed a qualitative analysis with the main objective of identifying which arguments would be used by the patients when we asked them why they had made a particular choice. As described earlier, our quantitative analysis was based on \"adequate response\" assumptions. Notwithstanding, to classify the choices only as right or wrong answers would have been very simplistic. We searched for the words that \n\n Magliano et al were most used by the interviewees to justify their choices, expressions that could represent misunderstandings and any other possible reasoning that could have led them to choose in an alternative way (not necessarily meaning they were unable to understand the task).\n\n All interviews were audio recorded in a digital format, and the data collected were analyzed qualitatively in a threestage procedure: 1) transcribing the data in preparation for analysis, 2) reducing the data to themes, and 3) representing the data. First, the data were fully transcribed and properly compared with the audio versions to detect errors. Then, we reviewed the data in search of repeated ideas or concepts, which were grouped into categories. A qualitative analysis was conducted on the patients' transcribed responses, preserving the terms they used to justify their choices. Such terms were cataloged in groups with similar meanings. No data analysis software was used to perform this task. Two researchers analyzed the transcripts independently. The criterion used to terminate data collection was sampling saturation. 10 \n\n In the first scenario, option \"A\" presented a risk of perioperative death of 2/50 (4%) and a risk of 18/50 (36%) of dying within 5 years. Option \"B\" presented a 30/50 (60%) risk of perioperative death and no further deaths during the 5-year period. We assumed that patients would choose the first option because there were fewer perioperative deaths and more long-term survivors (Figure 1) .\n\n In scenario two, the superiority of option \"A\" is even greater than in scenario one. The perioperative mortality is 10/50 (20%), as opposed to 30/50 (60%) for the second option. Our assumption was that patients would choose option \"A\" (Figure 1) .\n\n Scenario three presented a trade-off between worse/better perioperative mortality and better/worse long-term survival ( Figure 2 ). We hypothesized that in scenarios three and six, patients would keep their first choice, regardless of the option, when they repeated the task. We merely inverted the order of the alternatives, maintaining the same proportions of perioperative and long-term deaths.\n\n In scenario four, we assumed that patients would choose option \"A,\" since there were 30 patients still living within 5 years in both options, but option \"A\" had no perioperative mortality while option \"B\" had perioperative mortality of 10/50 (20%). We still hypothesized that in scenarios four and eight, patients would keep their first choice, regardless of the option, when they repeated the same task, similar to scenarios three and six. Between scenarios four and eight, we merely inverted the order of the alternatives, maintaining the exact proportions of perioperative and long-term deaths (Figure 3) .\n\n In scenarios five and seven (Figure 4) , there was no assumption of a \"correct\" answer. Scenario seven was designed to estimate the proportion of patients who were choosing between the options using a heuristic based solely on perioperative mortality. With a single perioperative death (2%) and another 39 deaths (78%) within 5 years, option \"A\" had a long-term survival of only 10/50 (20%). Option \"B\" presented high perioperative mortality, 10/50 (20%), and the 5-year survival was 40/50 (80%).\n\n A z-test for proportions was used to calculate whether choices made by patients were different from random choices.", "qa": [["50_21740219_1_1", "What factors did the researchers consider when predicting the choices patients would make in the scenarios presented?", "The researchers considered the percentages of mortality and survival, perioperative and overall risk, and the order in which the options were presented when predicting the choices patients would make in the scenarios."], ["50_21740219_1_2", "How did the researchers analyze the data collected from the interviews with patients?", "The researchers conducted a qualitative analysis of the data collected from the interviews.

PDT adequately controlled bleeding in six patients, the mean dysphagia-free interval was 80 days and the median survival 5.9 months ( Table 2 ). Another study included 40 patients with oesophageal tumours (19 adenocarcinomas, 19 squamous carcinomas, and two melanomas) in whom conventional treatments were unsuccessful [139] . At one month after PDT, the average minimal diameter opening of 28 accessible tumours increased from 6 to 9 mm and 35 patients improved in food intake from a liquid to a soft diet. Average survival time was 7.7 months for adenocarcinoma and 5.8 months for squamous carcinoma ( Table 2 ).\n\n An alternative method for palliation of obstructing oesophageal tumours is Nd:YAK laser therapy. However, a major limitation is the need for frequent treatments. Two randomised trials have compared Photofrin-mediated PDT with Nd:YAK laser therapy. In the first trial [140] 32 patients with dysphagia caused by biopsy-proven oesophageal malignancy were treated with PDT and 20 patients with Nd:YAK laser treatment. Among randomised patients, both PDT and Nd:YAK therapy relieved dysphagia, but PDT resulted in improved Karnovsky performance status at 1 month and longer duration of response ( Table 2 ). In the second prospective multicentre trial [141] , 110 patients with advanced oesophageal cancer were randomised to PDT and 108 to Nd:YAK. Improvement in dysphagia was equivalent between two treatment groups. Objective tumour response was also equivalent at week 1, but at month 1 was 32% after PDT and 20% after Nd:YAK (p<0.05). Nine complete tumour responses occurred after PDT and two after Nd:YAK. Trends for improved responses for PDT were seen in tumours located in the upper and lower third of the esophagus, in long tumours, and in patients who had prior therapy. Perforations from laser treatments or associated dilations occurred after PDT in 1%, Nd:YAK 7% (p<0.05). Termination of laser sessions due to adverse events occurred in 3% with PDT and in 19% with Nd:YAK (p<0.05) ( Table 2) .\n\n A newer prospective single-centre study compared 84 consecutive patients with advanced (group A) oesophageal cancer who were treated with Photofrin-PDT with a historical control group comprising over 1100 patients who were treated with different modalities like dilatation plus external beam radiotherapy, gastrostomy plus external beam radiotherapy, intubation/stent, bypass operation and laser plus brachytherapy [142] . Additional 18 PDT-patients with early stage cancer (group E) were compared with curative surgery. There was no mortality with PDT. All patients expressed satisfaction to the treatment. Post PDT complications consisted of photosensitivity skin reaction in 5 patients (5%) and oesophageal stricture in 8 (8%) patients. PDT was at least as good as other treatments in group A, with a slight advantage in patients with cervical oesophageal cancer. In early cases (group E), PDT appeared capable of replicating surgical results in selected cases ( Table 2) . If PDT is combined with brachyradiotherapy (BRT) the benefit can be even higher for patients as shown in a study by Maier et al. [139] , which compared BRT alone (n=75) with a combination of PDT followed by BRT (n=44). In some patients of both groups external beam radiation was delivered after the initial treatment. PDT produced a significant difference in relieving tumour stenosis and improving dysphagia score. A drawback was the occurrence of four oesophagorespiratory tract fistulas, one perforation and one haemmorhage with combination therapy in patients with T4 tumours ( Table 2) . Finally, another clinical situation in which PDT has been shown to be effective is in patients with oesophageal cancer who have tumour ingrowth after placement of expandable stents [143] .\n\n In summary, PDT is a safe and efficient method for the treatment of obstructing oesophageal cancer by relieving dysphagia in selected patients, however still has not become a first line procedure for the majority of patients.", "qa": [["0_24010943_3_1", "What is photodynamic therapy (PDT) and how is it used in the treatment of oesophageal cancer?\n", "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment method that involves the administration of a photosensitizing agent, such as Photofrin, followed by exposure to a specific wavelength of laser light.

The layers of the eye can be visualized in a painless, rapid and non-invasive way using OCT (3) . The choroid is one of the most highly vascularized tissues of body and it supplies the outer 1/3 of the retina. The choroid also plays important anatomical and physiological roles, including ocular thermoregulation, the regulation of intraocular pressure and growth factor secretion. Thinning of choroid tissue is a damage indicator (4, 5) . Previous studies have investigated choroidal thickness in healthy children (6) (7) (8) (9) .

The mass given for fragments is the total mass dissolved in the blood assuming a constant dissolution rate over a 50-year time span (a generally conservative assumption).

Consequently, care must be exercised when comparing internalized DU masses.\n\n The time dependence of the percent of inhaled DU remaining in the body is presented in Figure 2 for the acute exposure case.

Most of the 10% of DU remaining in the lung after 1 day will eventually be absorbed by the blood, and all but about one-third of the DU absorbed by the blood will be excreted rapidly in the urine. Thus, about 3% of the inhaled DU will be redeposited in the kidney, bones, and other organs. The DU deposited in these other target organs will be eventually reabsorbed by the blood and excreted in the urine or redeposited among various organs. Within less than 2 years, only 1% of the inhaled DU is retained. Figure 3 presents the time-dependent DU concentrations in organs (g DU/g organ) following inhalation for nominally exposed Level I veterans. The time-dependent DU mass per gram of organ for the combined effect of DU inhalation and embedded fragments for Level I veterans is presented in Figure 4 . When fragment dissolution is included, it is seen that the concentrations of DU in the kidney, bone, and liver do not decline appreciably after 100 days, and the DU concentrations in the soft tissues increase after a few years.\n\n (Soft tissues include a number of organs and tissue, such as the brain, gonads, and muscle.) The plots of organ DU concentrations for Level II and III veterans and downwind civilians show the same general trends observed in Figure 3 , although the quantities are orders of magnitude smaller than for Level I veterans. For children playing in DU-destroyed vehicles, the trends are somewhat different. Chronic DU exposure results in a gradual buildup of DU concentrations in organs up to 10 years (a child is assumed to play intermittently in the postbattle zone for a period of 10 years). Thereafter, DU concentrations decline relatively quickly as DU is eliminated from the body. Except for the lungs, ingested DU is the primary source of uranium to internal organs for children playing in vehicles, whereas ingested DU is of minor importance for all other exposure scenarios. DU concentrations in the kidney are also obtained from the biokinetic analysis in order to assess the potential for toxic effects on the kidney. The predicted acute and chronic DU concentrations in the kidney for veterans and civilians are presented in Table 3 .\n\n For Level I veterans, the lifetime doses presented in Table 4 were computed for a period of 50 years following exposure. Equivalent doses are given for nominal and maximum exposures assuming DU inhalation with and without imbedded fragments. The effective dose was obtained as the sum of the weighted organ doses. Effective doses of 0.0025 and 0.038 sievert (Sv) were predicted, respectively, for nominally and maximally exposed Level II veterans. For Level III veterans, the nominal and maximum effective doses are 2.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 and 5.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 Sv, respectively. The doses to the major organs for both nominally and maximally exposed Table 5 . For prolonged ingestion and the high DU ingestion rate estimated for a child at play, the radiation dose to the organs of the large intestines is comparable to the lung dose.", "qa": [["86_22406900_4_1", "What are the potential health effects of exposure to depleted uranium (DU)?\n", "Exposure to depleted uranium (DU) can have various health effects, including radiological and chemical effects on the fetus, the possibility of cancer induction from DU exposure, adverse effects on the immune system and bone formation, and the risk of cancer fatalities and genetic birth defects.

In the clam Lucina pectinata, the 28SrRNA fragment is not observed due to presence of a break point in the rRNA structure which converts the 28S rRNA to two fragments that migrate similarly to the 18S rRNA in gel electrophoresis. Hence, we assessed the reduction of rRNA content by analysis of the 18S rRNA peaks content versus the lower molecular weight abundant RNAs. Bioanalyzer traces showed that five out of the six RNA samples used for RNA sequencing had rRNA peaks eliminated and one of the samples had a 6.3\u00d7 reduction of rRNA content, demonstrating the utility of the RiboMinus kit employed for rRNA reduction in this type of organism. Then, these samples were fragmented by RNase III digestion for 3 min at 37 \u2022 C and purified following the Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) manual specifications. Sample yield and size distribution were assessed using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer\u00ae instrument.

In China, ANACONDA has specifically been used to train officials in mortality analysis, with these officials now able to show provincial authorities the flaws in their data and how to solve these. The introduction of ANACONDA through regional workshops with WHO, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has significantly expanded its use and has led to the initiation of related improvement efforts in medical certification and the recording of community deaths in several countries, among them Egypt, Iran, and Thailand. Given the demand for ANACONDA, we expect that the tool will be made publicly available at the CRVS Knowledge Gateway [24] before the end of the year.\n\n For statistical offices and other data producers preparing annual reports of vital statistics or inputs for burden of disease studies [25] , ANACONDA has much to offer in the form of checking the data for errors and inconsistencies, calculation of common mortality indicators, and numerous charts and figures. The figures and tables produced by ANACONDA can easily be exported as well as the cleaned data for further manipulation outside of the tool. A prefilled template available at the CRVS Knowledge Gateway [24] makes it possible to produce a comprehensive annual mortality report from the output with minimal efforts. Those who use ANACONDA regularly will appreciate the in-built monitoring function in the form of the VSPI(Q) that indicates whether their mortality system is improving or not changing at all, or whether they are managing to register more deaths and missing less child deaths.\n\n Although the main function of ANACONDA is to allow countries to comprehensively assess the accuracy and completeness of their mortality and COD data, it can be used for many other purposes (Fig. 11) . Apart from the user guide and resources integrated into the tool, a guidance manual for assessing and interpreting mortality data with ANACONDA is available to download through the CRVS Knowledge Gateway [24] . Based on the evaluations from such trainings, conducted in many countries under D4H, participants who received this instruction built capacity to apply basic epidemiological and demographic concepts for analysing their datasets and conducting mortality analysis.\n\n ANACONDA can also be used to inform the trainings of physicians in correct medical certification. For each country, it is possible to extract error patterns in certification and identify the exact codes that physicians misuse. This detailed assessment of medical certification is very valuable since it is known that country practices differ, and hence, a training that specifically incorporates country-specific issues is likely to be more successful in changing physician's certification practices. Fig. 10 Priority areas for action for a country ANACONDA is very useful for those countries interested in measuring their mortality burden. The tool allows countries to carry out a detailed and comprehensive audit of their mortality data, which is critical if subsequent estimates of the burden of disease are to be correctly interpreted for policy purposes.\n\n For countries and users considering the application of ANACONDA, there are a few limitations to keep in mind. The tool was developed with national datasets in mind, and therefore, small datasets, typically from hospitals for which no population at risk data exist, the steps involving the calculation of rates will not work. In addition, with less than 4000 deaths annually, some of the charts may have gaps due to small numbers for some age groups. Users should also be mindful that the analysis of garbage codes is based on the concept of the underlying COD; hence, if reported causes are taken from hospital discharge forms, the garbage code analysis will not be as informative as this is not the underlying cause (generally only reported on the death certificate). Because the COD data for ANACONDA must be entered with an ICD code, it is of limited use for VA data derived from the application of automated diagnostic methods since their cause lists do not provide individual codes. Perhaps more importantly, the comparators used in the tool mostly come from the GBD study, which attempts to estimate the likely true age-sex-cause pattern of mortality in a country after correcting for underregistration and garbage codes. The accuracy of the comparators is therefore likely to vary from country to country, and over time, depending on the amount of and reliability of the data and other information that was available on mortality and cause of death patterns for a country.\n\n ANACONDA has already proved to be a very popular tool for countries to assess the quality of their mortality data-in part because it does more than quality analysis. By making the tool user-friendly and explaining the rationale and objectives of the various steps, users can quickly appreciate the importance of identifying and monitoring data quality and errors. The tool empowers users to become activists for better data, to interact more effectively with medical associations and medical schools, and to apply innovative and generally cost- Fig. 11 The ANACONDA platform for mortality system improvement", "qa": [["31_212630009_5_1", "How does ANACONDA contribute to improving the accuracy and completeness of mortality and cause of death data?\n", "ANACONDA is a tool that allows countries to comprehensively assess the accuracy and completeness of their mortality and cause of death (COD) data.
