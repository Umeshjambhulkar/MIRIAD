It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required.

(2005) .\n\n The most common attitude regarding diabetes is that the disease is preventable. It was reported by 34% of respondents. 12% of the respondents responded that diabetes is not curable while 24% of the respondents reported that diabetes is more common among people over 40 years. The most common attitude regarding exercise, lifestyle and diet was supported by 20 (40%) respondents, who totally agreed that the diet regulation can prevent diabetes. That weight control prevents diabetes and people having sedentary lifestyle invites and exacerbates the disease was equally supported by 16 (32%) of the respondents. \"Patient is responsible for control of diabetes\" this statement was totally agreed by maximum i.e. 22 (44%) of the total respondents. The mean score of attitude among the respondents was found 53.06 \u00b1 7.43. As the score is greater than average i.e. 34; the attitude of community people is positive, which is consistent with the result of a study conducted aboout knowledge, attitude and practices regarding diabetes mellitus among the people by Shrestha & Nagra, (2005) .\n\n Knowledge is the greatest weapon in the fight against diabetes mellitus. Information can help people assess the risk of diabetes, motivate them to seek proper treatment and care, and inspire them to take charge of their disease. It is, therefore, in the interest of the country to design and develop a comprehensive health promotion strategy for diabetes mellitus and its related risk factors. It is equally important to design and implement suitable diagnostic, management and treatment protocols for people with diabetes. And developing country like Nepal is currently facing the double burden of disease via both communicable and non-communicable diseases. It is imperative that both the government and the community people themselves take necessary steps urgently so that the situation of health crisis may be avoided.\n\n I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor Professor Dr. Sarala Joshi for her continuous support and guidance.

Diabetes mellitus is an increasing problem in both Western and non-Western countries, with the multi-ethnic South-East Asian city state Singapore being ranked second globally after the USA (10\u00b753 and 10\u00b775 %, respectively) (2) , and having the highest rate of diabetes-related hospital admissions in adults (3) .\n\n Abbreviations: T0, 2 months before the introduction of the design plate; T1, 1 month after the introduction of the design plate; T2, 3 months after the introduction of the design plate; T3, 6 months after the introduction of the design plate.\n\n Both excessive amounts and lack of variety in food intake are important determinants of diabetes and obesity. While healthy eating programmes often focus on food group category intake, food pyramids may be difficult to interpret (4) . Instead, increasingly 'healthy plate' pictorials indicating proportions for vegetables, proteins and staples are used, including the United States' Healthy Eating Plate (5) , the UK's NHS Eat Well Guide (6) and Singapore's 'MyHealthyPlate'\n\n . Various studies conducted in both laboratory and restaurant settings have demonstrated that environmental variables influence food intake. Built environments influence the type and amount of food consumed on different levels. Borrowing from geographical paradigms, Sobal & Wansink (8) distinguish four ubiquitous microscale built environments (or 'scapes') that are persistent but often unrecognised: kitchenscapes (availability, diversity, visibility of foods), tablescapes (variety, abundance and accessibility), platescapes (portion, package size, and arrangement and utensils type) and foodscapes (food-item forms and landmarks). These factors provide a subtle, pervasive and often unconscious influence on food intake, obesity and health. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials concluded that people consistently consume more foods when offered larger-sized tableware (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Currently little is known about the potential influence of platescapes on food group intake. The effects of portion plates, where the recommended portions of vegetables, proteins and carbohydrates are printed on the actual plate, have only been studied as part of multicomponent interventions in small obese populations in Canada and the USA (14) (15) (16) . These studies showed that the combination of diet instructions sessions and a portion design plate seems to reduce weight. Bohnert et al. (16) showed that sixteen African-American adolescent participants selected less food overall, more fruit, more broccoli au gratin and less steamed broccoli when using a portion plate. A small study in diabetics and obese Japanese confirmed these findings in a Asian setting (17) . However, as these four studies included multiple intervention components simultaneously (including teaching nutrition value and focus behaviour and lifestyle change), the effect of the plate design itself remains unclear. Moreover, one of the main potential benefits of plate design on dietary intake is its preventive function in normal populations.\n\n Diet variations are large and platescapes vary between (and within) countries. The multi-ethnic city-state Singapore is known for its broad range of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western food options. The Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) 'healthy plate' guidelines recommend proportions of 0\u00b75 vegetables, 0\u00b725 proteins and 0\u00b725 carbohydrates per meal (7) . Adherence to these guidelines has not been studied. According to the latest national nutrition survey performed in 2010, only 11\u00b72 % of adult Singapore residents consumed at least two servings of vegetables and fruits per d, compared with 14\u00b73 % in 2004 (18) . As a common circular plate can be divided into four equal parts, and roughly caters to four servings, two servings can be compared with half a plate (0\u00b75 portions).\n\n This study aims to assess the impact of a design plate on the relative proportions of food group intake. We hypothesised that use of the plate will result in better adherence to the Health Promotion Board Singapore (HPB) guidelines for carbohydrate, protein and vegetable intakes.\n\n The setting for the present study was a hospital staff lounge in Singapore where lunch is served to about 120 staff each day from a buffet-style counter. A two-group quasi-experimental design was applied. For 6 months, starting in October 2015, lunch was served on a design plate (ETE plate\u2122, see Fig. 1 ) (19) , with portion guidelines printed in coloured lines indicating the various food groups to all staff who had lunch between 11.00 and 12.15 hours (design plate group).", "qa": [["16_865445_0_1", "How does obesity contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus?", "Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability globally and is known to contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus.

However, in Parkinson's disease, non-dopaminergic neuronal populations also degenerate (Hirsch et al., 2003) and this could contribute to the occurrence of non-motor symptoms and tremor; features that are not fully explained by dopamine loss alone (Fishman, 2008; Barone, 2010) .\n\n The serotonergic system, originating from the brainstem raphe nuclei, is known to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease. Post-mortem studies have observed a loss of serotonergic cell bodies with Lewy aggregates in the raphe nuclei (Molliver, 1987; Halliday et al., 1990 ) and a global deficiency of serotonergic markers in cortical and subcortical structures that receive raphe projections (Kish et al., 2008) . Additionally, Braak and colleagues have shown that Lewy pathology in Parkinson's disease occurs in the dorsal raphe nuclei ahead of the substantia nigra (Braak et al., 2003) .\n\n Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET imaging have been used to measure in vivo serotonin transporter levels in the raphe nuclei, an index of serotonergic neuronal integrity, in small cohorts of patients with Parkinson's disease (Haapaniemi et al., 2001; Murai et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003; Guttman et al., 2007; Albin et al., 2008; Caretti et al., 2008; Politis et al., 2010a; Strecker et al., 2011; Loane et al., 2013) . In these studies, in line with post-mortem findings, serotonin transporter binding was significantly reduced in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls (Berding et al., 2003; Guttman et al., 2007; Politis et al., 2010a) . In some studies, this was associated with severity of tremor and some non-motor symptoms (Doder et al., 2003; Boileau et al., 2008; Caretti et al., 2008; Hesse et al., 2009; Pavese et al., 2010; Politis et al., 2010b; Loane et al., 2013) .\n\n However, imaging studies of raphe nuclei integrity in early Parkinson's disease have been less consistent, with reports of serotonin transporter levels being normal (Haapaniemi et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003; Albin et al., 2008; Strecker et al., 2011) or mildly reduced (Roselli et al., 2010) . It should be acknowledged that due to the small number of patients investigated, these studies were probably underpowered to detect subtle changes in serotonergic transporter binding in early disease. Furthermore, imaging studies using 18 F-DOPA ( 18 F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine), a marker of aromatic acid decarboxylase activity, have demonstrated increased tracer uptake in the raphe nuclei of patients with early Parkinson's disease, suggesting that a compensatory increase in monoamine turnover rather than a decline initially occurs in these neurons (Moore et al., 2008; Pavese et al., 2011) . Therefore, the extent of serotonergic involvement in early Parkinson's disease remains to be fully elucidated.\n\n The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative is an international longitudinal study of early, initially untreated, patients with Parkinson's disease, healthy controls, and subjects with possible Parkinson's disease but without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) on imaging (Marek, 2003; Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative, 2011) . While SWEDDS may have been incorrectly diagnosed, some could alternatively have an underlying neurodegenerative process that disrupts neuronal systems other than dopamine (Marek et al., 2014) .\n\n All participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative undergo clinical screening for motor and nonmotor symptoms and are scanned with 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT.\n\n I-FP-CIT binds non-selectively to both dopamine and serotonin transporters.

In this way, the limited number of readers of a journal increased exponentially. The most important improvement in this area was the addition of PubMed Central (PMC) to the National Library of Medicine; this index became the main repository for journals published online [8] . PMC was launched in 2000 and is a free archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature. Although the standard criteria for indexing medical journals are also valid here, an additional requirement is the sending of the articles in a required format (mostly XML or SGML).\n\n The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is a good example of such repositories [9] . Not only PubMed but also other indexes are covered here. If we look at the number of journals in the DOAJ according to the country of origin, we see that Turkey is the 12 th country on the list (Table 4) [9] . Interestingly, Iran is the 11 th country on the list. This can be explained by the fact that all Iranian biomedical journals (n=163) have an open access mode [10] . In South Korea, one-third of the open access medical journals are archived in PMC [9] . Some privileged journals such as the BMJ and PLOS have a very significant online impact. Although a journal being indexed in PMC does not necessarily mean that it is also indexed in Medline, all PMC journals can be reached in PubMed. The reason for this is that PubMed covers: 1) MEDLINE indexed journals, 2) journals/manuscripts deposited in PMC, and 3) the NCBI Bookshelf [6] . During the transition of TJH to an international journal in the 1990s, main targets were to become an open access journal and to be indexed in the major databases. The first target was achieved in a short time, followed by indexing in various indexes such as the Science Citation Index Expanded, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, Gale/ Cengage Learning, EBSCO, DOAJ, ProQuest, Index Copernicus, and the T\u00dcB\u0130TAK/ULAKB\u0130M Turkish Medical Database [11] . During this process, TJH was one of the first medical journals in Turkey to publish on the Internet with the full text of articles available to readers.\n\n TJH made its first application to PMC immediately in 2000, as soon as PMC was launched. At that time, technical difficulties obstructed the path, but in 2013, TJH became indexed in PMC. TJH is the third journal indexed from Turkey and this number is increasing. Although this is a good Table 3 . Publication bias of included nested case-control studies analysed by funnel plot. achievement, compared to countries such as South Korea, India, or Iran, there is still a long way to go. One-third of the open access medical journals in South Korea are also indexed in PMC. This is also true for India, where nearly all biomedical journals are open access and some have found their way into PMC [10] . Supporting open access journalism is also an accepted strategy in developed countries such as the United Kingdom. In the UK, the government adopted a national strategy in 2012 that supports research funds for open access publishing.\n\n Despite these achievements, there are also problems with open access journals. The main criticism is directed toward the peer-review process. A recent paper published in the 4 October 2013 volume of Science [12] underlines one such important problem. Three hundred and four versions of a fake, non-existent study were sent to open access journals and nearly half of these peer-review journals accepted the study with minor or no revisions. This shows that as the stress of publishing online journals increases, the quality of the peer-review process decreases. Of course, this problem may also exist for non-open access journals. Another problem in open access journalism is the fee charged for manuscripts to be published. It looks as if the pressure on medical doctors for publishing new articles opened an avenue for financial benefit among companies that own or host open access journals.\n\n In the medical sciences, open access is a revolutionary approach to sharing and distributing research, development, and innovation, provided that strict rules for quality control are maintained all throughout the process.

He strove to explain transmission of sensory modalities in terms of the variety of molecular processes evoked in sensory nerves by different types of stimulation.\n\n The advance came from physiology rather than from neurology. Whereas, at the time, localization was the ruling interest of the neurologists, the physiologists were focusing on the electrical activity of nerves. The excitement was caused by the realization that the electrical activity of the nervous system could be used as a sign of its function. In the I84os Du Bois-Reymond,16. 17 the great physiologist at Berlin, had finally demonstrated unequivocally that activity in a peripheral nerve was invariably accompanied by an electrical change, a 'negative variation' in the standing potential that had been found between a cut end ofthe nerve and its longitudinal surface. This demonstration was the climax to a long-drawn-out struggle to confirm or deny the existence of Galvani's 'Animal Electricity'. Du Bois-Reymond did not under-estimate the importance of his demonstration. He said: 'If I do not greatly deceive myself I have succeeded in realizing in full actuality (albeit under a slightly different aspect) the hundred years' dream of physicists and physiologists, to wit, the identification of the nervous principle with electricity. ' Many workers soon confirmed that activity caused a negative variation in the Mary A. B. Brazier potential difference between outside and cut surface of peripheral nerve, and in due time the idea came to some workers in distant countries, England, Russia, Poland and Austria, that the passage of sensory impulses in the brain might similarly be detectable by an electrical change.\n\n The first to experiment with this idea was Richard Caton, a young lecturer in physiology at the Royal Infirmary in Liverpool. Following, analogously, the technique used for peripheral nerve, Caton put one recording electrode on the exposed cortex ofan animal and the other on a cut surface. For stimulus he used the light from an oxy-hydrogen lamp for he had no electric light. To his delight he found the change in potential he was looking for, but in addition he found something unexpected: when he had both electrodes on the surface of the cortex, or one on the cortex and one on the skull, he found an incessant, though feeble, waxing and waning ofcurrent in the absence ofall stimulation. This was the discovery of the electroencephalogram.\n\n Many decades were to pass before the electroencephalogram was used to localize brain function, and Caton's own interest certainly turned more to the phenomenon of the major potential shift that he found on sensory stimulation. In his first briefreport,\"' published in the British Medical ournal in I875, Caton included the following description:\n\n The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function. When a part of the grey matter is in a state of functional activity, its electric current usually exhibits negative variation. For example, on the areas shown by Dr. Ferrier to be related to rotation of the head and to mastication, negative variation of the current was observed to occur whenever those two acts respectively were performed. Impressions through the senses were found to influence the currents of certain areas; e.g., the currents of that part of the rabbit's brain which Dr. Ferrier has shown to be related to movements of the eyelids, were found to be markedly influenced by stimulation of the opposite retina by light.\n\n In his first brief report, one notices the marked impact of Ferrier's work and a tendency to expect related localizations for sensory responses and peripheral motor effects. Two years later, however, Caton reported further experiments that gave clearer results. He still proceeded to look for electrical changes in that part of the cortex stimulation of which by Ferrier had evoked movements of the head and also the area related to chewing movements. The results, as might be expected, were not too clear-cut. He reported as follows: '2 An examination was made of the currents of special areas. For example, the area pointed out by Professor Ferrier as related to rotation of the head was studied in six rabbits, with a view to discover if any change in the current occurred when the animal turned the head.

It is included in widely used methods such as the Hammersmith neonatal neurological examination [4] , the Amiel-Tison examination [5] and the Brazelton examination [6] . Visual assessment has led to reports of the emergence and maturation of some aspects of newborn visual function including ocular motility, acuity, color differentiation, attention and memory [2, 3, [7] [8] [9] . In this study, we highlight tests exploiting the oculomotor system [10, 11] .\n\n The oculomotor system is considered an indicator of neural functioning. It is represented by a complex interdependence between the sensorial system and ocular motility, and its command of muscular contraction is determined by the central nervous system [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, the application of scales to assess the ocularmotor system is time consuming and requires appropriate training. Furthermore, they are largely directed at older, bigger babies; little is known about the development of the oculomotor system in premature babies [2] .\n\n Premature babies face the possibility of a life with significant disabilities, including cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and visual and hearing dysfunctions [14] [15] [16] . These diseases incur significant costs both for families and society, due to the loss of human potential to work, and in terms of long-term health care [14, 17] . Multiple factors may predispose the preterm newborn to these deficits; among these, the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most important [18] .\n\n BPD is a major chronic lung disease of infants and it is indicative of comorbidities [16] . It generally occurs in preterm newborns undergoing oxygen therapy. Its evolution is associated with frequent and prolonged deaths and hospitalizations, especially those due to pulmonary complications, and comorbidities such as higher prevalence of cerebral palsy, neuropsychomotor development delay, cognitive impairment, and weight and height development disorders, thus giving rise to neurological and/or behavioral impairments [16, 19] . As it is considered a sign of comorbidity, impairments resulting from neurological and/or behavioral disorders can interfere with the growth and physiological development of the newborn, and may cause changes in various sensory and motor systems [17, 20, 21] .\n\n In view of the difficulties in accessing health care services in Brazil, the increasing number of comorbidities in preterm survivors with a diagnosis of BPD [22] necessitates the creation of a tool that will effectively evaluate aspects of visual function in a short time, as part of a routine assessment of infants at risk of developing visual and neurological abnormalities [2, 3] . The goal of this study is to develop a simple protocol to evaluate the oculomotor system in newborns with a diagnosis of BPD.\n\n This is a transverse analysis of preterm newborns who were born and admitted to either: the Intensive and Intermediate Care Neonatal Unit at the Children's Hospital in Goi\u00e2nia, Goi\u00e1s, Brazil, or the Inpatient Unit of Kangaroo Care Rooming at Dr Jos\u00e9 Pedro Bezerra Hospital, in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.\n\n This study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research at the Institute of Psychology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (2010.008), and by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte's Committee of Ethics in Research (065/11-P).

However, rather than vindicating the 'chance' approach and an indiscriminate use of probabilistic estimations, we should recognize our current epistemological uncertainty (i.e., ignorance) and acknowledge that our lack of knowledge could be amended by a better understanding of individual responses (Zernicka-Goetz and Huang, 2010) . See elsewhere for further discussion on these ideas (Merlo, 2014) . A didactical example may also clarify those concepts.\n\n If a risk factor affects the susceptible individuals, we should expect both the RR and the DA of the risk factor to be very high. We illustrate this situation using the classical PKU example (Fig. 6 ) where exposure to phenylalanine in the diet only gives clinical symptoms (a syndrome characterized by mental retardation, seizures, and other serious medical problems) in people with a mutation in the gene coding for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This enzyme is necessary to metabolize phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. When enzyme activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvate, which can be identified in the urine as phenylketone.\n\n Let us assume a population (N = 1,000,000) with 90% of the people exposed and 10% non-exposed to phenylalanine in the diet. In this population, 50 individuals (5/100,000) present a mutation in the gene that codifies the PAH enzyme. Among those with the mutation, 90% (n = 45) are exposed and 10% (n = 5) are non-exposed to phenylalanine in the diet.\n\n In a first scenario (A), we assume that we do not know of the existence of the mutation and perform a study in the whole population. We investigate the risk of PKU in people exposed to phenylalanine compared to those not exposed to phenylalanine. We will observe a RR of a very high (in fact, infinite) magnitude, indicating that only those exposed to phenylalanine develop PKU. Obviously, the TPF is 100%, as all the cases need to be exposed to phenylalanine. The PAF is also 100%, indicating that if we remove phenylalanine from the whole population we will prevent all the PKU cases.\n\n In the second scenario (B), we assume that we are aware of the existence of the mutation and perform the study on those with the mutation rather than on the whole population. The conclusion of our analysis will be very similar. The RR is infinite, the TPF is 100% and the PAF is 100%, indicating that if we remove phenylalanine from the people with the mutation we will prevent all the PKU cases.\n\n The difference between the scenarios (A) and (B) resides only in the FPF. That is, in scenario (A), almost 90% of the exposed do not develop PKU while in scenario (B) the FPF is 0%. This means that eliminating phenylalanine from the diet in scenario (A) will produce unnecessary discomfort in the vast majority of people, while in scenario (B) the discomfort will be limited and worthwhile, as it targets only those who would otherwise develop PKU. Admittedly, the PKU example is very simple and the identification of the individuals that react to cardiovascular risk factors may be much more complicated. However, this does not alter the fact that the distribution of individual risk is not a chance phenomenon and that knowledge of inter-individual heterogeneity of effects is crucial for planning efficient public health interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.\n\n We reiterate that a major problem is that measures of association disregard the heterogeneity of individual-level effects but are often presumed as the best estimation of what is assumed to be stochastics and undeterminable individual risk. This imposition of an average value on the individual is very common in Epidemiology and it has been denominated the \"Tyranny of the means\" (Tabery, 2011) or the \"Mean centric approach\" (Downs and Roche, 1979) . Alongside the medical field, this problem has been discussed in other scientific disciplines such as political science (Braumoeller, 2006; Downs and Roche, 1979) and evolutionary biology (Gould, 1996) .

Echocardiography often reveals a characteristic pattern including apical akinesia/dyskinesia and ballooning along with basal hyperkinesia [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although this condition is usually associated with an excellent prognosis and recovery with medical management in most patients [5, 6] , serious complications can occur, including most frequently pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock and less frequently cardiac rupture. We present here a case of a patient with an acute ventricular septal defect as a complication of Takotsubo Syndrome.\n\n The patient was a 71-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and cirrhosis, transferred to our hospital for management of acute decompensated heart failure. She was previously a highly active and independent individual until a recent tibial/fibular fracture from a mechanical fall. Her home medications were Insulin, Tramadol, and Bactrim. She presented from her rehab facility to an outside hospital with hyperglycemia (glucose greater than 700) and, on initial evaluation, was noted to have ST elevations in V3-V6, Troponin 4.46, and creatine kinase 130. She was diagnosed with a subacute myocardial infarction (MI). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, with apical akinesia and ballooning and hyperdynamic base (Figure 1 (Figure 1(b) , Video 2). She received intravenous (IV) diuresis, was initiated on IV heparin and a heart failure regimen, and was transferred to our hospital for further management.\n\n On arrival, she was afebrile with blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 on 3 L of oxygen. On examination she had a 3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex and was volume overloaded with jugular venous distension to 15 cm H 2 O and 2+ lower extremity edema. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversions in II, III, aVF, V2-V6, and prolonged QTc of 570 ms, patterns consistent with those described with Takotsubo Syndrome [2-4, 7, 8] . Repeat TTE on arrival, 11 days after the initial TTE, showed EF recovery to 75% (Figure 1 and elevated pulmonary pressures, with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 57 mmHg. The VSD was thought to be a major contributor to her continued decompensation. She was managed with diuresis and medical optimization and underwent evaluation for VSD repair. Although she had no prior echocardiogram for comparison, discussion with the patient's primary care provider revealed that she had no cardiac history and no documented cardiac murmur throughout her prior history. To rule out VSD as a complication of MI, the patient underwent left heart catheterization, demonstrating completely normal coronary arteries. Ventriculography confirmed VSD. Right heart catheterization demonstrated right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure of 42/14 mmHg, wedge pressure of 10 mmHg, cardiac output of 4.0 L/min, and index of 2.7 L/min/m 2 , with Qp : Qs ratio of 2.2 : 1, consistent with a large VSD. Given these findings, initial echocardiographic appearance of her heart, and rapid EF recovery, she was thought to have a rare case of ventricular septal perforation due to Takotsubo Syndrome. She underwent transcatheter closure of her VSD (Figure 1(d), Video 4) , was medically optimized afterwards, and was eventually discharged home after a prolonged hospitalization.

Diabetes therapy includes insulin for type I diabetes and antidiabetic oral (ADO) drugs for type II diabetes. Due to adverse effects of ADOs and economic reasons in some areas, herbal medicines has been widely used as an alternative therapy even in children [2] . Since the use of these natural sources is common, their safety and effectiveness should be ascertained. Herbal medicine is known to be effective in improving diabetes by several mechanisms one of which is by inhibiting enzymes regulating glucose metabolism. These include \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), aldose reductase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The suppression of these enzymes by secondary metabolites found in medicinal plants cause the release of insulin, and increase glucose uptake thereby lowering the glucose level in the blood. Flavonoids inhibit \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, aldose reductase and ACE. Triterpenoids and phenolic compounds disrupt DPP-IV [3] .\n\n Among medicinal plants, fenugreek is one that has been extensively studied due to its promising activity against diabetes. In daily use, fenugreek is usually mixed with other spices used as cooking ingredients, boiled and prepared like tea or as syrup, or combined with vanilla in cakes. Different parts of fenugreek have been used as folk medicine and have been noted to show potent anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and antiinflammatory activity [4] . Some researchers have examined its action against enzymes and have isolated compounds from it that contribute to its in hypoglycemic activity which will be described below.\n\n against \u03b1-amylase \u03b1-amylase plays a role in the breakdown of starch at the first step by stimulating the lysis of the 1,4-glucosidase bond. The inhibition of this enzyme decreases the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, which is reflected in a lower postprandial glucose value. Activity A study on extracts of fenugreek leaves showed that the ethyl acetate extract demonstrated a better inhibitory activity (250 \u00b5g/ml giving 64.55% inhibition) against \u03b1-amylase compared to the water extract [5] . Using 4 different solvents (methanol, chloroform, dichloromethane, hexane), another study determined the IC 50 of a seed extract, which showed moderate to weak inhibition activity (IC 50 less than 127 \u00b5g/ml) with the methanol extract showing the best activity [6]. A combination of omega 3 and fenugreek terpene disrupted amylase and maltase, thereby leading to a decline in blood glucose level [9] .\n\n Activity against \u03b1glucosidase \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1glucosidase are involved in breaking carbohydrates down to release glucose. Similar to its activity against \u03b1amylase, the leaves of fenugreek extracted using ethyl acetate showing more potent activity against glucosidase compared with the water extract glucosidase [5] . The seed extract displayed medium to minor activity against the enzyme (IC 50 less than 61 \u00b5g/ml) using different polar solvents (methanol, chloroform, dichloromethane, hexane) with methanol showing the best activity [6].\n\n Activity against DPP-IV DPP-IV contributes to the severity of diabetes. DPP-IV degrades GLP-1, another enzyme that stimulates insulin production and suppresses the release of glucagon [10] . Inhibition of DPP-IV results in a decrease in glucose levels in the blood. Sitagliptin is one of the conventional drugs that works by disrupting DPP-IV and corrects HbA1c level after 2-3 months of use [11] . Since its approval for clinical use, its adverse effects had not been documented sufficiently. Therefore, research into a better DPP-IV antagonist is ongoing. Some Indonesian medicinal plants demonstrated excellent activities against DPP-IV, and one of them is fenugreek. An ethanol extract of fenugreek seeds showed a potent inhibitory activity (71.29\u00b10.33%) against DPP-IV which was almost similar to the standard drug, sitagliptin (74.77\u00b10.3%) [7] .", "qa": [["38_209169710_0_1", "How does herbal medicine, specifically fenugreek, contribute to the treatment of diabetes?\n", "Herbal medicine, such as fenugreek, can be effective in improving diabetes by inhibiting enzymes that regulate glucose metabolism.

ST segment depression in inferior leads (II, III and aVF) was very common. This is consistent with previous reports. 24) ST segment depression in inferior leads in patients with LMCA occlusion may represent reciprocal changes of the injury current from the basal anterior septum as well as the injury current arising for the basal antero-lateral region. ST segment elevation in lateral leads (I and aVL) was also common. This finding is persuasive, because acute LMCA occlusion showed signs of extensive anterior infarction including the region perfused by the diagonal branch. ST segment elevation in the aVR lead, which is usually overlooked even in unstable angina caused from three-vessel disease or LMCA disease, has previously been described. 25) Engelen reported the aVR lead was very useful for identifying LAD occlusion proximal to the first major septal perforator. 26) In fact, ST segment elevation in the aVR lead was found in 9 patients (69%) in our study. This electrographic finding is probably the result of transmural ischemia of the basal part of the septum. For this reason, they found that none of the 10 patients with LAD occlusion proximal to the first diagonal branch but distal to the first septal perforator showed ST segment elevation in the aVR lead. Moreover, 5 of the non-survivors (83% except one VF patient) showed ST segment elevation in both the aVR and aVL leads.

This electrocardiographic finding, which obviously indicates the presence of extensive myocardial ischemia in the diseased heart, is a simple and important predictor suggesting a poor prognosis for the LMCA-AMI patient. Conclusion: As previously reported, LMCA-AMI with cardiogenic shock leads to a grave prognosis in spite of various management techniques. Our results indicate the clinical outcome of patients with LMCA-AMI is strongly dependent on the degree of intercoronary collaterals.

[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] CBT is a form of short-term psychotherapy, based on the concept that psychological distress is fuelled by erroneous cognitions. CBT holds that there are interactions between how we think (cognition) which can be faulty, how we feel (emotion), and how we act This review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) before the commencement of eligibility screening, with registration number CRD42015024458.\n\n \n\n \n\n A total of 4302 studies from 13 databases were obtained, of which 3054 studies were identified to be related to FGM after excluding duplicates (n=1248). Following title and abstract screening of the remaining search record, we identified 21 potentially relevant studies, which were further assessed for eligibility by obtaining their full-text articles. None of the 21 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion in this review. Five of the studies used participants other than those with FGM, 11 studies did not use appropriate intervention and control groups, and 5 studies did not use an appropriate study design.\n\n Despite a comprehensive search, we could not find evidence assess- Literature on the effectiveness of CBT for a wide range of mental health and psychosocial disorders is rich with several RCTs and systematic reviews. A good number of these RCTs and evidence reviews have used robust research methods to study the effectiveness of CBT for treating depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD in a general context or for related situations such as for victims of torture. 14, 18 For example, among combat veterans with chronic PTSD symptoms, CBT has been reported to have significantly reduced symptoms and improved overall psychosocial functioning. 19 It has also been reported to improve PTSD symptoms as well as depression and anxiety symptoms among individuals who experienced other types of trauma such as domestic violence and accident-related injuries. 20, 21 CBT helps trauma victims identify their dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs regarding the cause or consequences of the trauma, and then helps them learn the connection between these thoughts or feelings and their experience of depression, anxiety, or PTSD symptoms. 20 With this self-awareness, CBT helps patients to restructure and positively alter their dysfunctional beliefs and their emotions. 20 By effectively improving symptoms associated with trauma events such as sleep disturbances for example, CBT may help reduce not only PTSD symptoms, but also depressive symptoms, resulting in overall improvement in psychosocial functioning. 22 While none of these studies specifically addressed FGM, some of these studies may provide indirect evidence to practitioners or guideline groups who may wish to explore the use of CBT in persons suffering from the psychological sequelae of FGM.\n\n CBT, as the most researched evidence-based psychological intervention in the management of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, is a highly recommended psychotherapeutic method in a wide range of mental and psychosocial disorders. 23 What is more, some CBT-related stress reducing interventions such as psycho-education, breathing exercises, problem solving techniques, and strengthening of coping skills require minimal training and therefore can be implemented by frontline nonspecialist staff such as community mental health workers and lay health workers, especially among individuals with mild psychological symptoms associated with FGM. [24] [25] [26] [27] It has been suggested that such frontline nonspecialist staff can be trained to provide manualized therapy as part of a stepped care model, and to provide referral to more specialized and highly trained therapists in cases where patient functioning is not improved after using manualized therapy approaches. 28 Thus, CBT may be a cost-effective intervention in the management of psychological distress in women with FGM, especially those living in resource-constrained settings with limited access to specialist care.\n\n In conclusion, at present we cannot draw any evidence-based con-", "qa": [["53_23307807_0_1", "What are the psychological symptoms commonly experienced by women who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM)?\n", "Women who have undergone FGM often experience symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depression, and somatic disorders.

Calcium gluconate (10%; 10 mL) was slowly intravenously injected for treatment. Because of repeated symptoms, the patient was given continuous intravenous drip of calcium (10% calcium gluconate [100 mL] diluted to 5% glucose solution [1000 mL]). Acute symptoms were relieved after 3 d, and calcium carbonate (600 mg calcium carbonate was administered 3 times/d) and calcitriol (0.25 \u00b5g calcitriol was administered twice/d) were given routinely. Blood electrolyte changes during treatment are shown in Table 2 . Due to the patient's economic constraints, the patient required to be discharged automatically after 11 days of hospitalization.\n\n The patients did not attend follow-up visits regularly at our hospital, thus the followup data could not be obtained.\n\n Hypoparathyroidism is a clinical syndrome caused by insufficient secretion and/or influence of PTH. Its clinical characteristics are mainly manifested as hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased neuromuscular excitability as well as heterotopic calcification of soft tissues [1] . It is noteworthy that the clinical syndrome of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyper PTH are called pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) because of the resistance of target organs (e.g., the kidneys and bone) to PTH. Some patients have been reported to have special physical deformities, such as short stature, obesity, round face, short neck, short finger (toe), and even mental retardation, i.e., typical AHO [1, 4] . An epidemiological survey conducted in Japan showed that 58% of PHP patients were female [5] . A patient who has a singular sign of AHO while lacks a corresponding biochemical and metabolic abnormality is regarded to have pseudo-PHP [1] . The causes of hypoparathyroidism are varied. Neck surgery is the most frequent cause of hypoparathyroidism, accounting for about 75% [1] . Second, autoimmune diseases and genetic factors can affect parathyroid glands alone or simultaneously influence several other endocrine glands [6] [7] [8] . Gene detection is an important auxiliary diagnostic method. For example, type 1 autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, in addition to hypoparathyroidism, is also associated with Edison's disease, candidiasis, malignant anemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, primary hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroid disease and so on [9] . Moreover, abnormal magnesium metabolism, both hypermagnesemia and severe hypomagnesemia, could inhibit the secretion and function of PTH [6, 10] . If factors, such as surgery, inheritance, and abnormal magnesium metabolism are excluded, rare causes, involving invasive diseases, tumor metastasis, and ionizing radiation, should be considered [6] .\n\n In this case, the clinical manifestation of the patient was recurrent tetany in the past 10 years, and his personality gradually became isolated. The patient visited hospital because of slow reaction and speech difficulties. He had a positive Chvostek sign, while no AHO signs; he had no history of neck surgery or radiation; however, a history of cataract (suggesting ectodermal malnutrition) was found. Laboratory tests showed that total blood calcium and free calcium were significantly lower than normal, blood phosphorus was elevated, urine phosphorus was reduced, blood magnesium was normal, PTH was lower than normal, and bone turnover index was normal. There was no evidence of hypocalcemia caused by vitamin D deficiency, liver and kidney dysfunction, alkalosis, malnutrition, etc. No evidence of autoimmune diseases (e.g., hypofunction of adrenal cortex, autoimmune-related hypothyroidism, and diabetes) or tumors was noted as well. However, genetic testing could not be undertaken due to the limitations, thus genetic factors could not be excluded. Therefore, the etiology of hypoparathyroidism was undetermined. The patient's brain computed tomography showed manifestations in the basal ganglia, simultaneously suggesting the diagnosis of Fahr's syndrome.\n\n Basal ganglia calcification, also known as Fahr's syndrome or Fahr's disease, is a neurological disorder, in which there are calcium deposits abnormally in areas of the brain that control motor activity, leading to neuropsychiatric symptoms [11] .", "qa": [["80_208179578_1_1", "What are the clinical characteristics of hypoparathyroidism?\n", "The clinical characteristics of hypoparathyroidism include hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased neuromuscular excitability, and heterotopic calcification of soft tissues.

Our study provides additional information regarding transsacral corridor-size distributions and proportions of pelves based on their individually set cutoffs in clinical settings (Fig. 4) . Using the largest 10-mm diameter cutoff, as reported by Gardner et al. [8] and Moed and Geer [24] , transsacral osseous corridors at the S1 and S2 vertebrae would have been too narrow in 36% and 26% of pelves compared with 32% and 12% when using the 9-mm cutoff. Measured cylindrical diameters in our study (S1, 13 \u00b1 0.3 mm; S2, 12 \u00b1 2 mm) are similar to those reported by Lee et al. [19] (S1: 14 \u00b1 4 mm; S2 11 \u00b1 3 mm) and larger than those reported by Vanderschot et al. [37] . (S1, 8 \u00b1 0.9 mm; S2, 7 \u00b1 3 mm). Minor differences in several studies may be attributed to heterogeneity of the groups based on sex or the measurement techniques as discussed in a recent study [11] .\n\n In cases of sacral dysmorphism or too-narrow transsacral S1 corridors, it may be possible to place only oblique sacroiliac screws, according to Matta and Saucedo [20] , but alternative or additional transsacral screw placement at the level of the S2 vertebra may be considered [24, 29] . A compensatory larger transsacral osseous S2 corridor in dysmorphic versus nondysmorphic sacra [7, 8, 11] , was confirmed in our study, as shown by a weak negative correlation of the S1 and S2 transsacral corridor diameters. Furthermore, the larger range of maximum corridor diameters for S1 compared with the smaller more-sigmoidal distribution for S2 ( Fig. 4) shows the greater variability of the S1 osseous corridor shape and confirms the results of Wagner et al. [39] based on their investigation of 20 healthy pelves.\n\n We observed sacral dysmorphism in more female pelves than in male pelves, however, it was present in pelves of both sexes. Furthermore, corridor diameters were larger in male pelves than in female pelves. This sex-dependency has not been considered routinely in some studies published to date [2, 7, 9, 11, 29] . In contrast, Gardner et al. [8] reported no differences in the proportion of sacral dysmorphism between sexes in their cohort of 50 adult pelves, whereas Hasenboehler et al. [16] found a trend for sexdependent prevalence of sacral dysmorphism (19% of female and 12% of male pelves) in patients with trauma. There is a lack of common definition of sacral dysmorphism and studies are based on different cohort groups (age and sex distribution) [2, 7-9, 11, 16, 22, 24, 29] . Smaller transsacral S1 corridor sizes were observed in females compared with males [23] .\n\n We believe that because of the complex and highly individual variance of morphologic features of the sacrum, transsacral implant placement for fixation of posterior pelvic ring lesions remains demanding, and additional research is necessary for precise definition of the terms ''sacral dysmorphism'' and ''dysplastic sacrum''. Nevertheless, our findings provide the surgeon with additional information for safe transsacral implant placement. Sacral anatomy and potential transsacral screw corridor diameters are sex-dependent and should be considered in the preoperative CT scan analysis. In contrast to the scientific software program used in our study, three-dimensional volumetric measurement options are not routinely available in clinical software programs and therefore only a twodimensional measurement technique in two-dimensional reformatted images can be used. In axial slice images parallel to the S1 vertebra endplate the maximum corridor width (anterior border: S1 foramen or iliac wing; posterior border: spinal canal) must be determined, and in an orthogonal slice image reformation in a coronal plane, the corridor height (cranial border: surface of the alar pedicle; caudal border: S1 neuroforamen) must be measured.\n\n Depending on these measurements, the surgeon must decide whether to use transsacral implant fixation or an alternative fixation method (oblique SI screw placement, spinopelvic fixation, anterior iliosacral plating, or posterior ilioiliacal bridging plate fixation).", "qa": [["48_36548635_4_1", "What factors should be considered when determining the appropriate transsacral implant placement for fixation of posterior pelvic ring lesions?", "Factors that should be considered when determining the appropriate transsacral implant placement for fixation of posterior pelvic ring lesions include the absence of a transsacral corridor at the level of the S1 vertebra, the variability of sacral anatomy, different corridor diameter cutoffs based on implant types, sizes, and insertion techniques, and the presence of sacral dysmorphism or too-narrow transsacral S1 corridors.
