It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases.

Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

[52] and several others [53] [54] [55] [56] in the 1970s confirmed the anti-arrhythmic action of VNS. Several studies provide evidence that VNS is protective against experimental-induced VF using undiseased hearts [54] [55] [56] . Kent et al. [56] demonstrated a VNSdependent increase in the current required to induce VF, using a train of electrical pulses applied during the refractory period, that is, the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT), in the anaesthetised dog. Yoon et al. [55] similarly demonstrated a significant increase in VFT during VNS which was not maintained in the presence of the nonselective b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Similarly, a study by Kolman et al. [54] , in which the left stellate ganglion was crushed, demonstrated no anti-arrhythmic effect in control conditions but found significant protection when VNS was applied after stimulation of sympathetic nerves suggesting significant sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions in the anti-arrhythmic action of VNS, which are discussed in later. A number of studies have shown that VNS prevents arrhythmias as a result of CAO. Myers et al. [52] investigated the effects of low-and high-frequency VNS on spontaneous VF during acute CAO. Vagal stimulation was associated with an intensity-dependent reduction in VF occurrence that was coupled with higher survival rates. These data are supported by Kent et al. [56] . In the converse experiment, Corr and Gillis [57] found that bilateral vagotomy and atropine perfusion increased CAO-induced mortality, suggesting that intrinsic vagal activity was protective. In contrast, Yoon et al. [55] reported no effect of vagal stimulation on VFT in the ischaemic dog heart despite a pronounced response in non-ischaemic controls. A study conducted by Zuanetti et al. [58] demonstrated effects of bilateral vagotomy and of VNS on the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VF or fast sustained VT) following reperfusion of the ischaemic feline myocardium-a reduction in the incidence of both VF and fast sustained VT occurred during VNS whilst bilateral vagotomy resulted in a 55 % reduction in arrhythmia occurrence when compared to unoperated controls.\n\n Studies in a canine model of SCD An elegant canine model of SCD developed by Peter Schwartz and colleagues has been used extensively to study the protective effect of the vagus in conscious animals aimed at circumventing the confounding influence of anaesthetics [19, 20, 59, 60] . Animals are subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, instrumented for future studies and subsequently allowed to recover for 1 month. Surviving animals go onto a treadmill exercise test with progressively increasing workload together with CAO of the left circumflex artery from the start of the last minute of the exercise regime for a period of 2 min resulting in the reproducible occurrence of VF in 50-60 % of animals [20, 59 ]. An ischaemia-induced reduction in heart rate in those dogs which survived suggests that active vagal reflexes protect from malignant ventricular arrhythmias. De Ferrari et al. [19] later studied vagal tone in these animals. The authors found that muscarinic blockade with atropine promoted premature ventricular contractions, VT and VF in animals with no arrhythmia during control. The activation of strong vagal reflexes (i.e. HR reduction following CAO) was shown to be important for survival in 25 % of animals studied and was significantly correlated with measures of BRS.

Thus, the development of new therapeutic approaches to overcome this limitation and improve patients' outcomes is urgently needed. The addition of new compounds that negatively regulate genes involved in chemoresistance processes may help to overcome this obstacle. Here, we demonstrate that the natural carotenoid \u03b2-cryptoxanthin negatively regulates \u0394Np73, an oncogenic variant of TP73 gene involved in drug resistance processes. Importantly, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer based on the combination of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin with a conventional chemotherapeutic drug, oxaliplatin. The combined regimen produced more benefit than either individual treatment, without increasing side effects. In addition, the concentration-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin could be reduced in the presence of the carotenoid.\n\n Diet certainly plays an important role in preventing cancer, but the underlying mechanism is still not clear. Epidemiological evidence links consumption of carotenoids with decreased risk of various types of cancer (1) (2) (3) (4) . \u03b2-cryptoxanthin is one of the six major carotenoids routinely measured in human serum. It is contained primarily in citrus fruits (5, 6) , but also found in corn, peas and some yellow animal products.\n\n Numerous prospective studies show that serum levels of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin are inversely associated with the risk of a variety of cancers in several tissues (3, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .\n\n However, controversial results have been published, such as those describing no association between \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and risk of colon (20) , breast (21) , ovarian (22) and prostate cancer (23) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (24) .\n\n Additionally, several studies have demonstrated the protective effect of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin in carcinogenic-induced tumors of various tissues in animal models (4, (25) (26) (27) (28) . In contrast, few studies examine its possible therapeutic potential. Thus, in vitro, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin suppresses the growth of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells and non-small-cell lung cancer cells (29) , stomach tumor cells (30) and melanoma (31) . The mechanism by which \u03b2-cryptoxanthin exerts these effects remains largely unexplored (1) . These findings nevertheless indicate that \u03b2-cryptoxanthin could be used as an antitumor compound.\n\n Oxaliplatin, a third-generation platinum-based chemotherapy drug (32) , has a major impact on the management and outcome of colorectal cancer patients (33) Author Manuscript Published OnlineFirst on May 28, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR- colorectal cancer is still acquired resistance. The addition of new compounds to these treatments may overcome this obstacle and improve upon the outcomes currently achieved. In addition, new strategies that can diminish the neurotoxic effects of such treatments would be of interest (33) . Our group has demonstrated the involvement of \u2206NP73, an oncogenic variant of the TP73 gene, in proliferative and oxaliplatin chemoresistance processes. Its overexpression is associated with lower survival rates in colon cancer patients (32) , which points to a putative role as a therapeutic target.\n\n In the present study \u03b2-cryptoxanthin in combination with oxaliplatin significantly enhanced apoptosis of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The combined treatment led to similar growth inhibition to those consisting of double individual oxaliplatin doses, which could eventually reduce the effective dose of oxaliplatin and therefore, the associated side effects. Accordingly, the Comet Assay showed a reduction of the genomic damage in healthy cells from those mice treated with the combined regimen. Finally, we identified the down-regulation of \u2206NP73 variant as the mechanism underlying these effects.

High proliferative activity is often linked to tumour aggressiveness and is therefore considered a biomarker suitable for prognosis [35] . Furthermore, in radiotherapy-based treatment strategies the proliferative index of tumours is further considered a predictive biomarker of response. Reduction in proliferative activity in tumours, on the other hand, may function as a biomarker for therapeutic response assessment, especially with treatment strategies that have a primarily cytostatic effect. Consequently, significant effort has been dedicated to the development and validation of imaging biomarkers for tumour cell proliferation. Nuclear imaging techniques based on probing the so-called thymide salvage pathway, using tracers such as Br-BFU, are well-known examples for proliferation imaging [36] . In both preclinical [36] and clinical [35, 37] studies significant correlations have been found between uptake of these tracers and proliferative activity determined in tissue biopsies ex vivo. These tracers are still under investigation for their use as imaging biomarkers for early treatment response assessment. In various preclinical studies major decreases in 18 F-FLT uptake were observed following antitumour treatment [38] [39] [40] [41] . In these studies decrease in 18 F-FLT uptake also coincided with reduced proliferative activity or reduced tumour growth. However, despite the fact that similar observations were made in clinical studies, various limitations of these techniques have also been identified, including incorporation into mitochondrial DNA instead of nuclear DNA and high uptake in liver and bone marrow. These characteristics limit the specificity of these tracers for actual tumour cell proliferation. For FLT, a specific limitation is the fact that 18 F-FLT is not incorporated into DNA at all, but is only trapped in the cytosol [42] . FLT uptake is in that sense not directly related to DNA synthesis. This may be a main reason why in various forms of cancer no relationship between 18 F-FLT uptake and proliferative index or response to treatment has been found [35, 43, 44] . Because of the encountered limitations of these thymidine analogues alternative approaches for cell proliferation imaging have been explored. Recent efforts in this respect include probing of type II topoisomerase (Topo-II) activity and expression levels of the sigma-2 receptor.\n\n Topo-II is an ATP-dependent enzyme that is involved in cell cycle control and is essential in transcription, replication and chromosome segregation processes, and shows overexpression of one of its isoforms (Topo-II\u03b1) in various types of cancer [45] [46] [47] . Next to being an attractive target for molecular therapy, Topo-II is therefore also considered an attractive target for imaging cell proliferation [45] [46] [47] [48] . Some recent preclinical studies have shown the basic feasibility of generating imaging probes for Topo-II\u03b1. Further development and optimization of these probes is required though, since the tracers generated to date show unfavourable biodistribution in vivo [48, 49] .\n\n Another recently proposed target that may be suitable as an imaging marker of cell proliferation is the sigma-2 receptor. Sigma receptors are upregulated in rapidly proliferating cells, with the sigma-2 receptor being specifically overexpressed in proliferating tumour cells, i.e. tenfold compared to quiescent tumour cells [50] . Because of this specificity of sigma-2 receptor expression in actual proliferating tumour cells, it offers unique options in tumour imaging. Current efforts are therefore dedicated to the development of suitable imaging probes for the sigma-2 receptor [51] [52] [53] . A promising tracer in this respect is [ 18 F]ISO-1. Uptake of this tracer has been shown to be significantly correlated with Ki-67 expression in animal models [54, 55] , as well as in a first in-patient study [56] . In a recent preclinical imaging study, Shoghi et al. [57] evaluated the usefulness of this tracer in the measurement of the proliferative status of tumours and as a marker of early response. In two breast cancer xenograft models, they observed significant correlations between tumour uptake of the radiolabelled ligands and growth and proliferative status of the tumours (Fig.", "qa": [["71_16257528_1_1", "What are some imaging biomarkers used for assessing tumor cell proliferation?\n", "Some imaging biomarkers used for assessing tumor cell proliferation include tracers that probe the thymidine salvage pathway, such as Br-BFU, and nuclear imaging techniques.

Penh increased slightly for only 1 min after nasal challenge (the mean Penh value was 0.5370.25) and soon decreased to the earlier value (the mean Penh value was 0.3670.21). This result indicated that a nonspecific effect of drip liquid persisted only for a very short time. Histamine provoked a rapid increase in Penh within the first 2 min. Penh in these mice remained above the baseline level for the next 18 min (Figure 1) . The histamine-induced increase in Penh was almost completely reversed 3 min after the administration of epinephrine to the nasal passages. We confirmed that the intranasal administration of histamine did not provoke bronchoconstriction of the lower respiratory tract by histology (data not shown). This result indicated that airflow limitation in the nasal passage could affect the Penh value without affecting the lower respiratory tract.

Additionally, a number of ongoing studies are evaluating this agent in multiple indications for solid tumors.\n\n Most antiangiogenic agents -including ramucirumab -may cause some characteristic adverse effects, including some cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities [6, 7] . Moreover, renal toxicities (particularly asymptomatic proteinuria) are common in patients treated with antiangiogenic agents [8] . Because of the small number of patients with renal toxicities in each ramucirumab study, the overall risk of renal toxicities with ramucirumab may not be clear. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the overall risk of proteinuria in patients with solid tumors treated with ramucirumab.\n\n \n\n We conducted a literature review of the major databases, including Medline, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases from February 1966 to May 2015 using 'ramucirumab' as a search keyword. The search was limited to RCTs involving human solid tumor patients that were published in English. We also searched abstracts containing the same search keyword from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) meetings. We performed and systemically reviewed the meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRIS-MA) statement [9] .\n\n Clinical trials that fulfilled the following criteria were included: (1) RCTs in patients with solid tumors, (2) participants allocated to treatment with ramucirumab-based treatment versus control and (3) events and sample size available for proteinuria. For incidence analysis and relative risk analysis, we included RCTs that randomly assigned participants to either ramucirumab-based treatment versus placebo or control treatment.\n\n Meeting abstracts without subsequent full-text publication were excluded. Phase I studies were also excluded because of different dose ranges used. Independent review authors (O.A.-R. and H.E.) checked reports that included the search term by their titles and abstracts for relevance. Then, full texts of the relevant articles were assessed to evaluate eligibility.\n\n Two review authors (O.A.-R. and H.E.) independently conducted data extraction. The following information was recorded for each study: first author's name, year of publication, trial phase, underlying cancer, treatment regimens, number of patients available for analysis, and number of reported events of all-grade and high-grade proteinuria. Any discrepancies between review authors were solved by consensus. The number of patients evaluable for toxicity was utilized as the number analyzed for each study. In the included clinical trials, relevant adverse events were recorded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 or 4.0, which are quite similar in terms of grading these adverse events .\n\n The principal summary measures were relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% CIs of all-grade (grades 1-4) and high-grade (grades 3-4) proteinuria. For all calculations of RRs and CIs, we have used data extracted only from the included RCTs, comparing the incidence of each adverse event in patients assigned to ramucirumab-based treatment with those assigned to control treatment in the same trial. To calculate 95% CIs, the variance of a log-transformed study-specific RR was derived using the delta method. Statistical heterogeneity in results between studies included in the analysis was assessed through Cochrane's Q statistic and inconsistency was quantified through I 2 statistic. The assumption of homogeneity was not considered for p values <0.10. RRs were calculated using random-or fixed-effects models, depending on the heterogeneity of included studies. When substantial heterogeneity was not found, the pooled estimate calculated based on the fixed-effects model was reported using the inverse variance method. When substantial heterogeneity was found, the pooled estimate calculated based on the random-effects model was reported using the DerSimonian method, which considers both within-study and between-study variations [10, 11] .", "qa": [["21_44235389_0_1", "What are the potential adverse effects of ramucirumab treatment?\n", "Ramucirumab, like most antiangiogenic agents, may cause characteristic adverse effects including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, and renal toxicities.

A recent study on a tertiary stroke center with modern stroke care pathways showed that dysphagia still affects a substantial proportion of stroke patients and has a large impact on clinical outcome (more frequent pneumonia, less often discharged home and living at home at 3 months) and resource utilization (longer stay at monitored stroke unit beds, increased use of antibiotics and chest radiographs, more frequent use of nasogastric tube feeding) [4] .\n\n A recent US study of post-stroke dysphagia found that one-year attributable cost to Medicare for patients with dysphagia post-ischemic stroke was $4,510 higher than that for patients without dysphagia [5] .\n\n Though dysphagia has impact on hospital and post-discharge resource consumption, the initial burden of dysphagia diagnosis and management is undertaken by acute care especially by stroke units.

Multiple projects can be loaded on a single phone and the project to be undertaken can be switched from a dropdown list on the mobile app's homescreen.\n\n Data connectivity (e.g., 2/3/4G or wireless) is only required when initially loading the project into the app and when synchronising the data with the project database. Importantly, it is NOT required for entering data (GPS does not require data networks), allowing data gathering in remote areas with later synchronisation when data connectivity is available. Furthermore, data from GAE can be requested to the mobile app so that data previously collected by the user, and/or other data collectors, can be viewed on any handset being used in the project.\n\n The data collected from one or more phones during the survey can be viewed via the project homepage in two ways. Firstly, data can be listed in a tabular view, with columns based on the defined form fields, and all data can be downloaded in a number of formats (CSV/XML) for use and further interpretation outside of EpiCollect. Secondly, data can be viewed using a generic mapping interface ( Figure 3) . Briefly, all entries where location data have been captured (latitude/longitude via either GPS or wireless) are listed ( Figure 3A ) and can be viewed on a Google Map (or within Google Earth). The Google Map interface ( Figure 3B ) includes charts (pie and/or bar) for displaying data from fields defined as 'chartable' when building the project form ( Figure 3C ), and a temporal 'slider' allows only those points gathered within a particular time period to be viewed ( Figure 3D ). Data that are chartable can also be filtered based on choosing a particular 'answer' to a question that was presented to the users, so that only those entries where this answer is given are shown on the map ( Figure 3E ).\n\n Within EpiCollect we have focussed on complete generality allowing the design of any kind of project that would benefit from the collection of questionnaires along with location and photographic data. This generality is achieved by defining a project description using XML.\n\n For EpiCollect v1, we defined a set of XML tags (a vocabulary; 8 ) that allow all elements of project description to be defined in a single document. Within the online interface, the XML details are hidden from the user. However, in brief, when defining a form, the 'drag and drop' form builder produces an XML description of the form, including the name of the project. This XML file is then utilised both on the GAE server (for production of the generic map interface/tabular view when data is viewed) and within the mobile app when a project is loaded, to indicate the questions to be presented to a user and the location of the GAE server (tagged by project name) to send/retrieve data to/from.\n\n We utilise XML for a number of reasons. Firstly, it allows a standard and flexible vocabulary for defining projects; secondly, it allows users to host and undertake their own data gathering projects using their own databases and servers. By default, when loading a project on the EpiCollect mobile app, a request is sent to GAE for retrieval of the corresponding project description (in XML). However, XML can be loaded from any web location by typing in a fully resolved URL. Thus, by defining a project in XML (including server location and scripts for handling data exchange), and hosting on a local server, users can utilise the mobile app for data gathering and retrieve and store all data on their own servers. Further instructions are available in the developer's section at epicollect.net.\n\n Because XML is extensible, we can expand our vocabulary as and when required. As long as the software that utilises the XML 'understands' the vocabulary, tags can be defined which address greater complexity. Expansion of this principle (additional tags, interpreted by server and mobile software) forms the basis of progressing from EpiCollect v1 to EpiCollect+.\n\n While EpiCollect v1 may prove adequate for many types of projects, in other cases, a greater control over the flow of questions becomes necessary and projects may require the collection of multiple linked forms within a single project. Similarly, the limit (and requirement) for the collection of a single image and a single GPS may be restrictive and does not take advantage of other media types available to phones running the Android operating system. For example, the camera can be used to capture short videos, or for the extraction of data encoded in barcodes, the microphone can be used to capture sound clips.", "qa": [["30_5789409_2_1", "How does EpiCollect allow for data gathering in remote areas with limited data connectivity?\n", "EpiCollect allows for data gathering in remote areas with limited data connectivity by not requiring data connectivity for entering data.

We report a case of isolated ASD with severe PAH in an infant who developed airway obstruction as cardiomegaly progressed. The patient presented with recurrent severe respiratory insufficiency and failure to thrive before the repair of the ASD. Echocardiography confirmed volume overload on the right side of heart and severe PAH (tricuspid regurgitation [TR] with a peak pressure gradient of 55 to 60 mmHg). The chest radiographs demonstrated severe collapse of both lung fields, and a computed tomo graphy scan showed narrowing of the main bronchus because of an intrinsic cause, as well as a dilated pulmonary artery compressing the main bronchus on the left and the intermediate bronchus on the right. ASD patch closure was performed when the infant was 8 months old. After the repair of the ASD, echocardiography showed improvement of PAH (TR with a peak pressure gradient of 22 to 26 mmHg), and the patient has not developed recurrent respiratory infections while showing successful catch-up growth. In infants with symptomatic isolated ASD, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency associated with severe PAH, extrinsic airway compression should be considered. Correcting any congenital heart diseases in these patients may improve their symptoms. \n\n Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital cardiac lesion with an incidence of 6 to 10% 1) . Natural history of isolated secundum ASD in infancy and early childhood is generally benign, and presentation of symptoms or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is unusual at this age. Elective closure of isolated secundum ASD is performed in the fourth or fifth year of life in case of right-sided volume overload, preferably through interventional device closure 2) . However, some patients require closure of ASD much earlier because of severe problems, such as failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, or respiratory insufficiency. Sometimes left-to-right shunt can cause airway compression due to a dilated pulmonary artery. We experienced an infantile case in which a patient with an isolated secundum ASD had persistent PAH and collapse of both lungs due to extrinsic compression of both main bronchi by a dilated pulmonary artery and intra-pulmonary bronchial obstruction.\n\n A 1-month-old corrected age, male infant weighing 3.4 kg was transferred to our institute because of respiratory insufficiency. He was prematurely born by Caesarean section with a birth weight of 1,070 g at 32 +1 weeks of gestation, and was small for gestational age. The patient was admitted for 50 days including neonatal period and treated with O2 for the first 4 days after birth due to pneumonia. There was no evidence of hyaline membrane disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) also. On the physical examination, bronchial breathing sounds were increased with rhonci. Regular heart beats were heard with grade 2 systolic murmur on left upper sternal border. He was diagnosed as secundum ASD in the neonatal period. Echocardiography confirmed secundum ASD (diameter 7\u00d712 mm), right-sided volume overload, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with a peak pressure gradient of 55 to 60 mmHg, dilated main pulmonary artery (diameter 19 mm) and both pulmonary artery (diameter 11 to 12 mm). When the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was estimated from the peak flow velocity in the TR jet by using the modified Bernoulli equation, his pulmonary artery pressure was 58 to 65 mmHg. At first admission, he was intubated and ventilator care was needed because of progressive respiratory distress. The chest radiographs demonstrated severe collapse of both lung fields at the time (Fig. 1) . CT was performed to rule-out other diseases associated with PAH at the corrected age of 1 month. A CT scan showed a collapse in the dependent portion of the right lung and a total collapse in the lower lobe of the left lung. Narrowing of main bronchus and right intermediate bronchus were evident and an intrinsic cause like bronchomalacia was suspected (Fig. 2) .

Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is usually characterized histologically by a spectrum of fibrosis in the alveolar walls. Clinically, the term IPF is used in cases of chronic ILD with fibrosis that fails to respond to corticosteroid treatment. Others limit the use of the term to chronic ILD with predominant fibrosis that is progressive and unresponsive to corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive agents. It is the lack of resolution of the inflammatory response in the pulmonary interstitium with the progression of fibrosis that distorts the alveolar walls and leads to restrictive lung disease and interference with gas exchange. These are the critical factors in determining prognosis of chronic ILD.\n\n The management of this patient points out some of the problems in classification as well as the management of chronic interstitial lung disease in children. It is difficult to evaluate the effect of host factors, such as age, in the natural history of chronic ILD in children and thus in the assessment of response to various therapeutic interventions. The evaluation of the course of chronic ILD in infants and very young children is especially difficult because remodeling of the lung is occurring as a part of their normal growth as well as a response to injury. In adults, the neutrophil appears to play a very pivotal role in the amplification of the chronic inflammation in IPF, and activated macrophages release cytokines as growth factors for mesenchymal cells. It is not known how much of the information derived from clinical and research studies in adults can be extrapolated to children with chronic primary ILD.\n\n Glucocorticosteroids have been used in the treatment of chronic ILD in both adults and Some studies report the release of high levels of oxygen-free radicals by inflammatory cells and the reduction of glutathione and other antioxidant components in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.78\n\n These studies were the basis of the use of the aerosolized glutathione.\n\n Unfortunately, there has been no consensus in the definition or classification of chronic ILD in children, and thus it is difficult to evaluate the role of any proposed Hilman therapeutic agent. What is included in single case reports or review of a series of cases of this heterogeneous group of disorders of chronic ILD varies from author to author. There are no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of chronic ILD in children, with the exception of the histologic examination of lung tissue. There are also some differences in the classification of the lung biopsy findings by pathologists, even if they confirm thickening of the alveolar walls due to inflammatory and immune effector cells and/or fibrosis. In addition to the more familiar terms for primary chronic ILD in children-desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), pulmonary hemosiderosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia-various other terms are used, such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. It has been suggested that bronchiolitis obliterans interstitial pneumonitis, one of the histologic types of ILD, differs in clinical spectrum and prognosis from other types of primary chronic ILD. Bronchiolitis obliterans can be associated with known causes such as adenovirus as well as unknown causes. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia is a term that often refers to a specific type of ILD due to unknown etiology. Rigante et al are to be commended on obtaining a lung biopsy for documentation of ILD. The biopsy was obtained after months of symptoms of dry cough, dyspnea with medium exertion, a chest roentgenogram showing diffuse infiltrates, and computed tomography of chest showing diffuse interstitial involvement. The lung biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis with focal lymphocytic infiltration. In this patient report, there was a clinical improvement with reduction of cough and improved exercise tolerance after treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine, although there was no improvement in the pulmonary functions.

It is estimated that more than 600,000 deaths each year globally are from cryptococcosis [1] . The most common clinical presentation is cryptococcal meningitis. Pulmonary and other presentations are less common, and disseminated infection may occur [2] . Although the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially reduced cryptococcosis prevalence worldwide, it is still a major problem in developing countries. Without appropriate treatment, cryptococcosis is fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to treatment success. Treatment of cryptococcosis consists of three main aspects: antifungal therapy, intracranial pressure management for cryptococcal meningitis, and restoration of immune function with ART. Optimal\n\n AIDS Research and Therapy *Correspondence: somnuek.sun@mahidol.ac.thintegration of these three aspects is crucial to achieving successful treatment and reducing the mortality.\n\n ART has proven to have a great impact on survival rates among HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis [3, 4] . The relapse rate of cryptococcal meningitis after antifungal therapy is also substantially reduced in patients receiving ART [3] . However, the time to start ART in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis has to be carefully considered. A randomized trial has recently demonstrated that deferring ART for a specific duration after the start of antifungal therapy improved survival rates among patients with cryptococcal meningitis, as compared with immediate initiation of ART [5] . This improved survival associated with deferring ART was observed in patients with advanced HIV infection. An integrated therapy of both cryptococcosis and HIV based on the current evidence of studies from both diseases can yield better survival. This article focuses on the integrated therapy for HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis and details regarding diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcosis, initiation of ART, management of drugdrug interaction, overlapping toxicities of antifungal and antiretroviral drugs, as well as cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n\n Infection by Cryptococcus is believed to occur mainly after inhalation of desiccated yeast cells or basidiospores into the alveoli. Other proposed portals of entry include gastrointestinal tract, direct inoculation from trauma, and transplantation of an infected organ [6] [7] [8] . In HIVinfected patients, dissemination may follow. Alternatively, Cryptococcus may initially establish a latent infection within thoracic lymph nodes or a pulmonary granuloma of a healthy host. These dormant viable yeast cells reactivate when the host becomes subsequently immunosuppressed. Cryptococcus can infect nearly any organ, but the most common are the central nervous system (CNS) and the lungs. Wide ranges of clinical manifestations and severity have been reported, depending on involved organs, patient's immune status, and species or strains of the yeast. HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis frequently present with disseminated disease [9] .\n\n Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of CNS cryptococcosis. Symptoms and signs include headache, fever, cranial neuropathy, alteration of consciousness, lethargy, memory loss, and meningeal irritation signs [2, 9] . These signs and symptoms typically have a subacute onset, although acute and chronic onset can also be observed. Classic signs of meningeal irritation can present in a minority of patients [9] . Increased intracranial pressure often complicates cryptococcal meningitis and contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality [10] [11] [12] . Patients with cryptococcoma usually have focal neurological deficits, blindness, seizures, as well as signs of increased intracranial pressure [13, 14] . Other reported neurological complications include cerebral infarction from cerebral vasculitis, and venous sinus thrombosis [15, 16] .\n\n Pulmonary cryptococcosis has clinical manifestations varying from asymptomatic colonization to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Common signs and symptoms in HIV-infected patients are cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and constitutional symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and weight loss [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic infection among HIV-infected patients, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and in South and Southeast Asia. The widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially reduced cryptococcosis prevalence worldwide, but it remains a major problem in developing countries. ART has proven to have a great impact on survival rates among HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis and reduces the relapse rate of cryptococcal meningitis. However, the timing of ART initiation in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis needs to be carefully considered, as a randomized trial has shown that deferring ART for a specific duration after the start of antifungal therapy improves survival rates in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in those with advanced HIV infection."], ["65_16629294_0_3", "What are the possible portals of entry for Cryptococcus infection?\n", "Cryptococcus infection is believed to occur mainly after inhalation of desiccated yeast cells or basidiospores into the alveoli.

Additionally, Cryptococcus may initially establish a latent infection within thoracic lymph nodes or a pulmonary granuloma of a healthy host, which can reactivate when the host becomes immunosuppressed. Cryptococcus can infect nearly any organ, but the most common sites are the central nervous system (CNS) and the lungs."]]}, {"passage_id": "56_70460103_0", "passage": "Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues and is a frequent complication in patients who have suffered traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. Currently there are few effective treatments for this condition. This research seeks to develop engineered osteoclasts as a local cell therapy for the prevention and/or regression of HO. The goals of this research are to develop proof-of-principle data in excised human HO specimens and in an animal model using existing murine engineered osteoclasts and to develop an off-the-shelf human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell source for clinical translation of this technology. To date we have performed studies to optimize various hydrogel formations as cell delivery vehicles. We will use these hydrogels to retain engineered osteoclasts at sites of HO in vivo.

Subtask 1 & 2: Generation of RAW iRANK cells for testing in vivo and optimization of local cell delivery at time of surgical implantation and after HO has formed in mice Confirmation of HO formation in nude mice: (PI: Sangeorzan, Harborview) For our in vivo studies we are using nude mice to allow for the transplantation of allogeneic engineered cells. Prior to initiating cell delivery studies, we performed a pilot study to confirm that the absence of lymphocytes in nude mice does not affect HO formation. For this pilot study, nude mice were anesthetized and Matrigel carrier impregnated with BMP4 (2.5 ug) was implanted in the mid-belly of the right calf. HO formation was evaluated by microCT at 10, 17, and 28 days post-implantation and the volume of ectopic bone nodules and the percent mineralization was calculated. As expected, ectopic bone nodules formed in nude mice following implantation with BMP4/Matrigel. As shown in Figure 1 , nodule size increased with time. At Day 28 the average nodule volume was 1 mm 3 and the percent mineralization (BV/TV) was 24.7%.\n\n - Figure 1 .

During the past year we have performed in vitro studies to determine whether encapsulating engineered RAW iRANK cells in hydrogels affects osteoclastogenesis. In initial studies, engineered RAW iRANK cells were encapsulated in varying concentrations of collagen and were cultured in the presence of AP20187 to induce osteoclastogenesis. To encapsulate cells in collagen gels, cells were resuspended in media supplemented with neutralizing buffer (100 mM HEPES in 2x PBS). Collagen was then added and mixed quickly before plating gels in 4-well chamber slides. As a control, cells were plated directly on the surface of chamber slides. Media containing 50 nM AP20187 was added to the top of the gels and cells were cultured for 7 days. Cells were then stained for TRAP and the number of osteoclasts per high powered field (HPF) was counted via microscopy. Encapsulating cells in collagen gels had no significant effect on osteoclast formation compared to control cells plated directly on culture dishes ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Encapsulation of engineered cells in collagen gels does not significantly affect osteoclastogenesis. Engineered cells were encapsulated in varying concentrations of collagen gels and osteoclastogenesis was induced by CID treatment. As a control, cells were plated directly on culture dishes (TCPS).\n\n We subsequently tested two additional hydrogel formulations (fibrin and Matrigel) as potential carriers for in vivo cell delivery.

After cancer surgery, PMV patients showed poor prognosis, which could be attributed to the cancer itself as well as the development of cancer recurrence/metastasis after surgery [19, 20] .\n\n In a study involving 429 patients which evaluated hospital and long-term outcome after tracheostomy for respiratory failure, the results showed that those who were weaned off MV and placed on tracheostomy tubes had lower 3-year mortality than ventilator-dependent patients (P < 0.001) [21] . In the present study, the patients not inserting tracheostomy might often meant with high risk of death, and have increased the use of sedatives and opioids, maybe dependence on MV ultimately, which was associated with prolonged 1-year mortality.\n\n Critically ill patients on MV are at risk of underfeeding and progressive malnutrition, and this population often receives less than the required energy and protein [22] . Enteral nutrition (EN) is preferred over parenteral nutrition (PN) because it is more physiological and less likely to result in hepatobiliary dysfunction and electrolyte imbalance [23] .

There was significant difference between the ProVent score and the combination of our multivariate factors in predicting 1-year survival using ROC curves, however, the sample size was relatively small and the comparison might be unconvincing.\n\n This study had major limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small. Patients requiring PMV after surgery had a small sample size, with a percentage of only 0.5% in our study.

Before stenting, the traces displayed the typical lengthening pattern just before AVC, followed by a knee point at AVC and a shortening or plateau right after AVC. The derivative of these traces exhibited the distinct postejection velocity spike. After stenting, lengthening was allowed to continue uninterrupted as the stent prevented valve closure and allowed blood to flow back from the aorta into the LV. The smooth transition from shortening to lengthening essentially removed the postejection velocity spike. The average magnitude of the velocity spike was reduced from 22\u03ee11 mm/s before stenting to 2\u03ee3 mm/s after stenting (P\u03fd0.001).\n\n As demonstrated by the representative recordings in Figure 6 (top) and summarized in Table 3 , the preejection and postejection velocity spikes were synchronous throughout the LV. The maximum time difference of the 4 measured preejection velocity spikes (pre a ) was 11\u03ee11 ms; it was 12\u03ee8 ms for the postejection velocity spikes (post a ).\n\n Representative velocity recordings from the different clinical substudies are shown in Figure 7 . \n\n In patients with mitral valve regurgitation, the peak preejection velocity spike (pre a in Figure 1 ) was 43\u03ee25 before valve surgery and 32\u03ee15 mm/s afterward (P\u03ed0.036). Minimum velocity of the downstroke of the spike (pre b ) changed from 6\u03ee15 to \u03ea11\u03ee13 mm/s (P\u03ed0.002). These changes indicate a trend toward less shortening before MVC and more complete interruption of shortening by the valve prosthesis. In patients with aortic regurgitation, the peak postejection velocity spike (post b ) was virtually unchanged after valve surgery: 14\u03ee25 mm/s before and 19\u03ee12 mm/s after (P\u03ed0.56). However, minimum velocity at the bottom of the upstroke of the postejection velocity spike (post a ) changed from \u03ea32\u03ee11 to \u03ea17\u03ee11 mm/s (P\u03ed0.0003), indicating that LV wall lengthening occurring before AVC was reduced after valve surgery.\n\n In the normal subjects, the preejection and postejection velocity spikes occurred simultaneously in the septal and lateral walls (Figure 6 , bottom). Mean data are presented in Table 4 . In each patient, MVC occurred during downstroke of the preejection velocity spike, whereas AVC occurred during upstroke of the postejection velocity spike.\n\n In patients with atrial fibrillation, a distinct preejection velocity spike clearly was present. The average peak velocity (pre a ) was 31\u03ee12 mm/s, and the minimum velocity of the downstroke (pre b ) was \u03ea8\u03ee16 mm/s.\n\n In patients with third-degree AV block, pacing with a short and nominal AV delay did not alter the preejection velocity spike (37\u03ee20 and 39\u03ee11 mm/s, respectively). In contrast, pacing with a 300-ms-long AV delay altered the morphology of the velocity trace, and 2 preejection velocity spikes were present ( Figure 7 , bottom right). After atrial contraction, a small positive spike (16\u03ee8 mm/s) appeared during atrial relaxation (indicated by an arrow in Figure 7 on the bottom right). This spike occurred before activation of the LV and is consistent with elastic recoiling of the LV during atrial relaxation. The second preejection velocity spike was 37\u03ee9 mm/s.\n\n This study demonstrates that the preejection velocity spike in normal LV myocardium is due to early systolic shortening, which is interrupted by MVC, and the postejection velocity spike is due to late systolic lengthening, which is interrupted by AVC. These mechanisms were supported by observations in healthy human hearts and by animal experiments that included implantation of stents over the mitral and aortic valves to prevent valve closure. When MVC was prevented, the preejection velocity spike was abolished, and when AVC was prevented, the postejection velocity spike was abolished, confirming the role of valve closures in generating the velocity patterns.\n\n Valve stenting represents extreme cases of valvular regurgitation. As demonstrated in this study, even patients with severe mitral and aortic regurgitation have relatively preserved preejection and postejection velocity spikes.
