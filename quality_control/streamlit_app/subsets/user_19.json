Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

What role did medicine play and did it change with medical professionalization? The North American drive westward, leading to extinction of the buffalo on the prairies around 1870, promptly threatened native inhabitants with starvation. The Canadian government stepped in with emergency rations and also, in exchange for the old hunting grounds, it agreed to settle aboriginal peoples on reserves and aid them in becoming farmers. The food and support was so niggardly that it failed to prevent either starvation or a rebellion in 1885, but none the less the principle was recognized: the government bore some responsibility for the life of these displaced people. But did it owe them health?\n\n The government made almost no provision for medicine in the early days. Despite massive illness, most ofit due to poverty, doctors were not part of the package offered to native peoples in the late nineteenth century. Governments did not owe their tax-paying, Euro-Canadian voters health: these voters paid for doctors themselves or received religiously-inspired charity. The same would have to do for the Indians on the prairies. Most missionairies sent out by the Catholic and Protestant churches claimed to possess \"a moderate and practical knowledge of medicine\". Moreover, the doctor-patient encounter was irrelevant to the \"Indian problem\". Indians were dying out as a species because their culture was maladaptive, so it was claimed, and they had to be doctored as a species by ideological and social engineering, at the hands of bureaucrats. If Indians still fell ill and died, that only proved they had failed to assimilate to Western standards of hygiene and industry and their assimilation should be further expedited.\n\n Doctors, thus, barely figure in Maureen Lux's bleak account of the events and the discourse surrounding the reduction of the prairie population in Canada up to the turn of the twentieth century. Their absence does not reflect any ignorance on the part of the officials and missionaries as to the importance of medicine. On the contrary, they made it their lives' work to root out the medical practices and knowledge prevalent among the aboriginal populations. According to Hayter Reed, deputy superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1896, \"The 'medicine men,' the guiders of thought and action and the inspirers of fear in all but the very boldest, had to be fought. To win Indians from such a thraldom, and to get them to disregard the influences of generations, required no small amount of courage and skill in management.\" Indian medicine, which is to say culture, stood between the bureaucrats and assimilation. But rather than replace Indian medicine with white medicine (bad enough as that might have been), they replaced it with a lot of rhetoric in favour of liberal individualism.\n\n Doctors creep into the story with the residential schools, which were established around the same time to expedite assimilation and prevent children going the way of their parents. The Canadian government could not duck a certain responsibility to combat the tuberculosis and scrofula devastating the young students in its care. Home care originated in the actions of the Charleston Ladies Benevolent Society, which provided medical care, along with other types of charitable assistance, to the \"worthy\" poor as early as 1813. Like the legions of home care workers who succeeded them, the ladies confronted what one superintendent later dubbed the \"vexing question of the chronic patients\". The Society's mission was to serve patients in acute distress, but many members were reluctant to abandon those who failed to recover quickly.\n\n After the Civil War, wealthy women in various cities hired trained nurses to visit the homes ofthe sick poor. Unaware of the Charleston example, those philanthropists drew on the English model of district nursing. Buhler-Wilkerson chronicles the transformation of the early visiting nurse associations, as the progressive-era tenet of efficiency gained hold. She also discusses the onerous responsibilities of the nurses, who worked eight to twelve hours a day, six days a week. Home visits involved notjust bedside care for individuals but also attempts to reform and \"uplift\" the entire household.\n\n Buhler-Wilkerson chose not to criticize the nurses' actions and attitudes from today's perspective. Some readers, however, may wish to question the nurses' assumptions in greater depth. The belief of Ellen LaMotte, a leading tuberculosis nurse, that poverty led to low intelligence and lack of control is clearly open to challenge. The determination of many other early-twentieth-century nurses to disperse the many neighbours who flocked to medical events can be variously interpreted. Although the nurses were convinced that most neighbours were ignorant and superstitious, recent medical history suggests that the nurses' insistence on the superiority of their own knowledge was not always deserved. The new understanding of the role of social networks in healing similarly indicates that the care delivered by neighbours", "qa": [["7_36414200_0_1", "How did the Canadian government's provision of medicine and healthcare change for native peoples in the late nineteenth century?\n", "In the late nineteenth century, the Canadian government did not provide medicine or healthcare for native peoples.

[10, 11] In addition, few Indian studies investigated clinical and microbiological profile in patients without DM [12] and patients with DM vs. patients without DM. [3, 13] This is the first Indian study that studied not only the clinical and microbiological profile of UTIs in patients with and without DM but also empirical therapy for UTI in them.\n\n Our finding that patients with T2DM had significantly higher ASB than patients without DM (32% vs. 6%) is similar to a recent meta-analysis. This meta-analysis reported a point prevalence of ASB of 12.2% among patients with DM compared to 4.5% among healthy control subjects. [2] However, a prospective study from India found no significant difference [3] and also reported a comparatively higher point prevalence of 30%.\n\n This study found that significantly fewer patients with DM had fever than patients without DM. Similarly, a 2014 study from North Korea comparing symptoms of acute pyelonephritis in community dwelling women with T2DM vs. women without DM found that significantly fewer women with DM had symptoms of upper UTI (flank pain and costovertebral tenderness with or without symptoms of lower UTI) and lower UTI (frequency, urgency, dysuria, and suprapubic pain). [14] This is in contrast to the finding that DM patients are more vulnerable to have a more severe presentation of UTI [15] though diabetic neuropathy can cause alteration of signs. An Indian study found no difference between clinical presentation of UTI in patients with and without DM. [3] Another Indian study found no statistical difference with regard to fever, burning micturition, and vomiting though they were common presenting symptoms; this study also found that patients with DM had a significantly more increased urinary frequency, dysuria, flank pain, and hematuria and urinary incontinence. [13] Although it cannot be concluded from this study, the lack of fever in DM patients may be associated with the altered immune response in patients with DM. [16] We found that DM patients had a significantly higher history of previous UTI than the patients without DM. A similar finding was also reported by Indian studies [13, 17] and also by a Dutch study. [18] However, another Indian study did not find statistically significant difference regarding the history of previous UTI though it was reported by 27% DM patients and 18% patients without DM.

This is similar to the higher prevalence of pyelonephritis reported in men and women with DM vs. men and women without.

In general terms, it is well established that the partial double bond character of a peptide bond gives rise to its planar structure, and free rotation is restricted about this bond [47] . We hypothesize that with sufficient thermal energy and free volume present in the system, two local motions could take place for exendin-4, which would give rise to the \u03b2-relaxation process: (1) local side chain rotations, and (2) local rotation about two single bonds [45, 48] . Given that the amino acids of the exendin-4 polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds, rotational freedom arises from the single bonds between an amino group and the \u03b1-carbon atom and the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone [47] .\n\n However, the rotation of these bonds is limited by steric hindrance [47, 48] . Based on the chemical structure of the exendin-4 this polypeptide can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor via its carbonyl groups (-C=O) or as a hydrogen bond donor via its amine group (-NH), and its hydroxyl groups (-OH) can act as both the hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. The linear PLGA-[C 3 H 4 O 2 ] x [C 2 H 2 O 2 ] y -chains include the methyl side groups of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and oxygen atoms at every third position of the copolymer backbone, and C=O bonds which introduce significant structural rigidity to the copolymer backbone. Specifically, hydrogen bonds can form: (1) between the carbonyl groups of PLGA and the amine groups of exendin-4, (2) between the amine groups of exendin-4 and the hydroxyl group of PLGA, and (3) between the hydroxyl groups and the carbonyl groups of exendin-4 and PLGA. Additionally, van der Waals as well as dipole-dipole interactions between the peptide groups and the hydroxyl groups can serve to stabilize the system [49] . These strong interactions, the dynamics of which are infrared active, can reduce molecular mobility and improve the physical stability of these systems [3, 29, 30] . Notably, it is conceivable that with additional free volume and thermal energy input large-scale rotational motions of the backbone dihedral angles in the polypeptide chain could occur, which could lead to large-scale changes in chain conformation, contributing to the \u03b1-relaxation.\n\n We observe three regions with two distinct transition points, T g,\u03b2 and T g,\u03b1 for both the PLGA 50:50 and PLGA 75:25 microspheres (Figure 4 ). For the PLGA 50:50 formulation, the high exendin-4 loaded microspheres have a significantly higher T g,\u03b2 = 219 K, than the blank and low polypeptide loaded microspheres (T g,\u03b2 = 167 K, and T g,\u03b2 = 168 K, respectively). In the polymer dispersion, exendin-4 can form hydrogen bonds with PLGA. Intuitively, an increase in exendin-4 loading would correspondingly increase the hydrogen bonding interactions between the polypeptide and PLGA [48] , reduce the molecular mobility of the system, which would raise the value of T g,\u03b2 [9, 50] . Indeed, we observe a significant increase in T g,\u03b2 for the high polypeptide loaded microspheres, compared to the T g,\u03b2 value observed for the blank and low polypeptide loaded microspheres. Notably, for the blank and low exendin-4 loaded 50:50 microspheres, the onset for local mobility occurs at approximately the same value of T g,\u03b2 . This could suggest that the low polypeptide loaded microsphere behave similarly to the blank microspheres, due to the limited interaction between peptide and polymer [46, 51] . For the blank microspheres and low exendin-4 loaded microspheres, the onset for local mobility occurs at approximately the same value of T g,\u03b2 , (T g,\u03b2 = 167 K). For the high exendin-4 loaded microspheres, T g,\u03b2 increases significantly (T g,\u03b2 = 219 K).

Thus, it is advisable to practice the respiratory motion with the patient at this point. In the authors' opinion, the approach which seems to be most successful is to instruct the patient to \"breathe in, breathe out, breathe in and breathe out, and stop.\" Inform them that they are expected to suspend expiration for approximately fifteen seconds and that the hyperventilation breathing should allow them to fill their lungs with air to comfortably sustain the period of suspended expiration. Mitchell [32] also concurs that suspended expiration is more consistent, and provides less motion variation, whereas full inspiration should be reserved for situations where the lung diaphragm needs to be in a more inferior position. It is imperative that the patient understands their role and that their co-operation and active participation is needed to ensure overall diagnostic success. If the breath hold technique is not adequate, then the CBD and the main pancreatic duct may not appear to unite or may appear either stenotic or dilated [33] .\n\n The next critical component is positioning of the patient, the respiratory bellows and the imaging coils. At this point, the adult patient should be lying supine on the MRI table positioned appropriately over the posterior half of the body array coil and also such that their feet will be entering the bore of the magnet first. To position the respiratory bellows correctly, the radiographer must first observe the rise and fall of the patient's chest and abdomen with their breathing [34] . It is wise to repeat the breathing instructions while observing the patient's chest and abdomen. The respiratory bellows need to be positioned across the point where the maximum difference in rise and fall occurs. Once the respiratory bellows are positioned, the radiographer must then observe the respiratory waveform that appears on the operator's console. It must display the distinct rise and fall wave patterns and these patterns need to be regular. If the patient has breathing difficulties or can only take shallow breaths, one method to ensure a respiratory wave pattern is to place the respiratory bellows diagonally across the region (either the chest or the abdomen) that corresponds with the patient's breathing. From the authors' clinical experience, this will ensure that any respiratory motion will be detected. However, when the respiratory pattern from this technique is observed on the console monitor, it may only display shallow peaks.\n\n Next, pads or sponges are placed alongside the respiratory bellows. These prevent the respiratory bellows from being compressed by the weight of the anterior half of the imaging coils. If the respiratory bellows were to be compressed they would be unable to detect the patient's respiratory motion or may not accurately represent the respiratory waveform pattern. This will then have an adverse affect on the pulse sequences which are required with the use of respiratory triggering.\n\n This section focuses on the pulse sequences used, their weightings and image planes, and most importantly, validates the reasons for using the parameters to attain maximum diagnostic information. It should be noted that these imaging tools vary from one clinical centre to another [2, 8, 35] and that there are numerous valid reasons for such differences. These may include the preference of the reporting radiologist, adhering to an already established protocol which may be a part of an ongoing prospective study; pulse sequences available from a particular manufacturer, and pulse sequences and technical capabilities available or inherent to a particular software operating platform. The following discussion relates to pulse sequences available on the GE 1.5 Tesla twin speed magnetic resonance (MR) scanner using the HDx operating platform (General Electric Medical Systems, Wisconsin, USA).\n\n Always commence with a T1-weighted three plane localiser as this sequence provides low spatial resolution images demonstrating anatomy for orientation purposes. These images are thus used for identifying the initial required anatomical structures for subsequent planning or prescription of the diagnostically proper pulse sequences. This sequence should be acquired with the patient in suspended expiration so that these low resolution images are not further degraded by respiratory motion artifacts.\n\n The purpose of this sequence is to obtain imaging of the hepatic ducts, biliary tree and pancreatic duct in the transverse plane. Fat suppression improves conspicuity of solid lesions and also minimises phase ghosting artefacts from subcutaneous and intraperitoneal fat. This is of greater importance in respiratory triggered sequences [8] . The transverse or axial plane is the most common and therefore familiar of all the imaging planes and it is an orientation which we can easily recognise. By varying the required technical factors a balance of acceptable image quality and scan time can be achieved. Typically, the scan time achievable is approximately between fifteen and twenty seconds.

High air velocity will enhance the evaporation of water, resulting in a faster temperature decrease, especially at the cornea (see below). High air velocity (.1 m/s) may result in a slight increase of BF during resting conditions; 28 this, however, can be overruled by visual tasking; for example, game playing or VDU work. 27 In the latter case, VDU work becomes a special case in which BF decreases, becoming consistently overdue as a result of cognitive functions (effort). This causes BF to fall below ''average'' and possibly a widening of the exposed cornea, thus resulting in an increased water evaporation, possibly Main messages N To avoid ocular surface dryness (that is, precorneal tear film break-ups and corneal dry spots), it is important, in particular during demanding visual tasking, for example, VDU work, with specific regard to computer design activities such as CAD-CAM, CAT, etc, to depress water evaporation by allowing sufficiently high periocular relative humidity.\n\n N Normal blinking and a small exposed ocular surface minimise water loss and early rupture of the precorneal tear film.\n\n N Sources of volatile chemically reactive compounds should be kept under surveillance, in particular in the presence of ozone.\n\n followed by ruptures as a result of an APTF (cf. Golding et al 40 and Miller et al 41 ). High RH reduces the BF, 42 43 and an inverse proportionality regarding the ambient temperature has been observed. 43 In addition, BUT was found to be lower in dry and warm environments compared to that of cold and humid environments 44 (cf. Berke 45 ); similarly, BUT was found to be inversely associated with increasing temperature among female nurses. 46 This, of course, may possibly have been the result of an associated lower RH. The findings support the fact that APTF recurs under conditions favouring water loss. For example, it was found in a crossover study in public office buildings that a 1\u02daC decrease in temperature (within 22-26\u02daC) correlated with 19% decrease of the mean value in severity of eye complains (dry, itching, irritated). 47 The mean prevalence for eye complaints increased slightly from morning to afternoon in public buildings, 8 48 49 which is compatible with the observation that the LL thickness decreases during an office working day, 50 concurrently with an increase of the room temperature. 51 Note that the intensity of symptoms among dry eye patients is significantly greater in the evening than in the morning. 8 It is of note that BUT similarly decreases and eye irritation increases over time under controlled climate conditions of clean air. 52 Increased water evaporation from the OS results in cooling of the cornea and the lids, in particular during condition of low BF, low RH, and upgaze, or combinations thereof. 53 54 Rapid cooling appears to be related to APTF, possibly due to its inability to retard the evaporation, thus stimulating blinking. 55 For example, subjects whose cornea showed a slower cooling following a blink showed a greater capacity to avoid blinking for a prolonged period of time. 56 On the other hand, the corneal temperature in dry eye patients varied less than that in normal control subjects, possibly because of less water evaporation from the PTF of dry eye patients. 54 This agrees with the proposal that thermosensitive cold fibres in the cornea may initiate reflex blinking by cooling. 32 54 Stimuli which modify neural activity in the sensory fibres of the cornea and conjunctiva, such as increased evaporation or additional humidification, may change the involuntary BF. Evaporation of water has also been reported to increase in dry eye patients, accounting for the majority of the water loss, 57 partly because it ''pulls ahead'' the tear secretion.", "qa": [["6_27627608_2_1", "How does high air velocity affect water evaporation and temperature decrease in the eye?\n", "High air velocity enhances the evaporation of water from the eye, leading to a faster decrease in temperature, especially at the cornea.

They are usually asymptomatic or without a characteristic symptom. The incidence in autopsy studies ranges from 0.064% to 0.18% ( 1 ) . With the widespread use of imaging modalities adrenal cysts are encountered more commonly than previously. We present our technique of laparoscopic adrenal cyst excision in two cases.\n\n A 39-year-old male presented with a few days history of nonspecific loin pain and abdominal distention. On abdominal examination, no lump was palpable. Another patient, a 46-year-old male presented with a cyst, which was incidentally found by abdominal ultrasonography while he was being investigated for urinary tract infection (UTI). Routine laboratory tests and endocrine function tests were within the normal range for both patients. Ultrasonography (USG) showed a large clear cystic mass of 6 x 8cm at the upper pole of the right kidney in the first case and a cystic mass of 15 x 16cm at the upper pole of the right kidney in the second case ( Figure 1 ). \n\n The operation was done under general anesthesia by a transperitoneal approach. A gastric tube and a urinary catheter were placed and full left lateral decubitus position was chosen. The table was flexed and the kidney rest was raised to maximize the space between anterior iliac spine and inferior costal margin.\n\n A pneumoperitoneum was created using a Veress needle. Four trocars were used. The first 10mm optical trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line under the costal margin and a 30 degree laparoscope was introduced through this trocar. The second 10mm trocar was introduced caudally 5cm from the optical trocar, in the anterior axillary line. The pneumoperitoneum was maintained at 12mm of Mercury (Hg). Since the cysts were large, they were easily seen protruding below the liver margin. The cysts were punctured using monopolar cautery and the contents were sucked using a 5mm suction tip pushed through the most lateral trocar ( Figure: 3). This action prior to the formal dissection facilitated the dissection by collapsing the cyst and creating space for instrument maneuverability. Two more 5mm trocars were introduced under direct vision. Both of them were placed under the costal margin, 7cm on either side of the optical trocar. The collapsed cyst wall was grasped and mobilized by incising the subhepatic peritoneum using a coagulating hook. An atraumatic liver retractor was introduced through the extreme left trocar for delicate cephalad retraction preventing any injury. Mobilization of liver helps in identifying the vena cava. The vena cava was dissected, exposing the renal vein and the main adrenal artery. The main adrenal vein was successfully controlled with Haem-olock \u2122 clips and divided. Retraction of the gland caudally and laterally facilitated access to the arterial pedicle, which was clipped and divided. Caudal retraction helped to identify the superior adrenal artery, which was dissected, clipped and divided. Similarly, cephalad retraction helped to identify the inferior adrenal artery, which was clipped and divided. The remaining few attachments were carefully dissected using monopolar cautery. The specimen was grasped with an atraumatic grasper and introduced into an extraction bag. The extraction was done through the 10mm trocar opening. A drain was placed from the most lateral trocar after achieving haemostasis. Each 10mm trocar site was closed using absorbable suture.\n\n Both cases underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and the cysts were completely removed. Operative time was 190 and 170 minutes. Blood loss was 100 and 70ml with an average of 85ml. Drains were removed on the second postoperative day. Hospital stay was 2 days for both patients. On followup after 2 weeks, the patients were without any symptoms.\n\n Pathological examination showed the cysts to be epithelial adrenal cysts (Figures 4 & 5) . Follow-up USG after 3 months was normal in both patients. Smaller cysts are usually incidentally found during the evaluation of unrelated abdominal conditions. There is no predilection for the right or left gland. Literature review shows 8% incidence of bilateral adrenal cysts. All age groups are affected. There is a 2:1 female predominance. ( 4 ) Traditionally, adrenal cysts have been divided into neoplastic and non-neoplastic groups. Non-neoplastic lesions are of four general categories: endothelial lined cysts (45%); pseudocysts (39%); cysts secondary to infectious agents such as echinococci and epithelial-lined or true adrenal cysts (9%). ( 2 ) Of these, endothelial-lined cysts and pseudocysts are most common and comprise approximately 90% of cases. Epithelial-lined true cysts are rare, and theoretically could be retention cysts (glandular), or arising from adrenal cortical adenoma and embryonal cysts. Epithelial cysts have true epithelial lining, which can be confirmed by special immunoperoxidase studies with antibodies to keratin. ( 3 ) Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has emerged as the treatment of choice for benign functioning and non-functioning surgical adrenal disorders. ( 5 ) When compared with open adrenalectomy, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is associated with a shorter length of hospitalization, lower analgesic requirement, decreased convalescence, less operative blood loss, rapid dietary intake, superior cosmesis, and lower postoperative complication rates ( 6 ) .\n\n Various laparoscopic approaches have been reported to treat adrenal cysts using the transperitoneal and the retroperitoneal approach. Castillo et al. have described their experiences with transperitoneal laparoscopic cyst decortication and marsupialisation. ( 7 ) Both cases were treated with aspiration of the intracystic fluid followed by complete dissection of the cyst and removal.\n\n Adrenal epithelial cysts are rarely encountered pathological entities. Laparoscopic dissection is a good treatment option for large adrenal cysts. Intracystic laparoscopic fluid aspiration helps in three ways:\n\n To decrease the size of the cyst thus creating free 1.\n\n space for further port insertion & laparoscopic dissection.\n\n The collapsed cyst wall can be grasped and used 2.\n\n for traction facilitating dissection.\n\n Decrease in size of the cyst helps easy organ 3.\n\n This technique of meticulous aspiration of fluid is thus of immense help in laparoscopic surgery.

The same report indicates that, in Spain, the prevalence of problem opioid use was less than 2.5 per 1,000 in 2011. 3 Of particular interest is whether these changes are a mere reduction in numbers or whether there have been changes in the profile of patients seeking treatment in more recent years. Recently, profile analyses have been conducted regarding the use of tobacco, 7, 8 alcohol, 9 and cocaine, 10 but there has been less research concentrating on heroin users. There is indeed evidence of a high prevalence of dual disorders in opioid users. 11, 12 For instance, the COPSIAD study, 13 also conducted in Galicia, reported a high prevalence of personality disorders (26.5%), mood disorders (20.6%), anxiety disorders (11.9%), and psychotic disorders (7.6%) in 805 persons who sought treatment for heroin use at specialized units.\n\n The following variables have been identified to have an influence on the level of disability in opioid-addicted patients: age, with a greater probability of polyconsumption of addictive substances amongst younger populations; 14 sex, with females showing a lower incidence of opioid addiction, more psychiatric disorders, 15 more chronic health problems, and lower levels of social and occupational functioning, 16 their partners having a greater influence on initiation of use, and females also more frequently practicing prostitution and sharing injecting paraphernalia; 17 psychiatric comorbidity, with figures ranging between 44% and 93% of persons seeking treatment; 12, 18 infectious diseases, with a 25-year longitudinal clinical study conducted in Spain reporting that 47.2% of a sample was also diagnosed with HIV and 81.1% with hepatitis B/HCV; 18, 19 and legal problems, which are associated with greater severity of addiction, and, in some clinical samples, even survival at 12 months. 19, 20 These variables determine a variety of user profiles that have an influence on preventive and therapeutic decision making. 21, 22 For instance, patients with less severe profiles (fewer physical and psychiatric comorbidities, less polysubstance abuse, fewer incarcerations) will benefit from shorter programs while those with more severe profiles will benefit from long-term maintenance programs. 23 Females would require more exhaustive assessment because they have a higher risk of a more severe profile and, as a result, may need more intensive and individualized treatments. 24 The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of the profile of those who started treatment for opioid addiction for the first time between 2005 and 2010 at the addictive disorders assistance units in Galicia.

However, mechanistic insights explaining the link between obesity and increased cancer risk are notably lacking. Nowadays, it is accepted that obesity-associated chronic inflammation constitutes a contributing factor to the promotion and development of carcinogenesis [28, 29] . Moreover, increasing evidence has emerged showing that the microenvironment plays a prominent role in determining tumor behavior [30] . To our knowledge, we show for the first time that obese patients with CC exhibit increased circulating levels of the ECM-and inflammatory-related proteins OPN, YKL-40 and TNC. In the obese state, the unbalanced deposition of ECM proteins in adipose tissue contributes to the formation of fibrotic depots, mechanistically related to the chronic inflammation state, which creates an optimal microenvironment for the tumor cells. Thus, altered expression of ECM proteins may represent a link between adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity and obesity-related cancer. Recent findings have identified the involvement of OPN in CC progression with important functions in tumor infiltration and metastasis [18] . Multiple and complex mechanisms are involved in the role of OPN in cancer, including interactions with cell surface receptors, growth factor/receptor pathways, and proteases [31] . Emerging evidence underlines the potential of OPN to provide useful clinical information in the management of patients with cancer. OPN plasma levels have been found to be increased in patients with different cancers, with these higher levels being correlated with higher tumor size and staging [32] . Remarkably, we found increased OPN levels in patients with CC, which were also higher in obese patients suggesting that OPN could be a link between obesity and CC. In this line, a novel tool described for the early detection of CRC is the combination of different serum markers, including OPN [33] . An inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor colony formation by silencing of OPN has been described in human CRC cell lines highlighting its potential as molecular target for gene therapy [34] . The results of our study also demonstrate that circulating OPN significantly correlates with fibrinogen, a key pro-inflammatory biomarker upregulated in obesity also described as an independent negative prognostic marker to evaluate cancer patient risk [35] . We determined that the cut-off point for the concentration of OPN that had the best prognostic potential on the risk of CC was 48.5 ng/mL. Thus, these data suggest that for the asymptomatic obese patients, elevation of circulating OPN could be considered as a predictor of CC development. Interestingly, similar results have been obtained evaluating the role of OPN in the risk of coronary atherosclerosis [36] .\n\n YKL-40 is produced by cancer and inflammatory cells exhibiting a role in inflammation, cell proliferation and regulation of extracellular tissue remodeling and angiogenesis [37] . Specifically in CRC, high serum YKL-40 has been associated with an increased risk in subjects without co-morbidity [38] . In this regard, we observed that YKL-40 concentrations were significantly increased not only due to the presence of CC but also to obesity.

The 2013 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) reported that approximately one out of three male adults and approximately one out of four female adults has hypertension, with adults defined as persons 30 years of age or older [1] . Excessive sodium intake is significantly associated with hypertension, which leads to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke [2, 3] . One of the main causes of hypertension is high sodium intake [4] . The 2013 KNHANES estimated the mean sodium intake of Korean adults at 4,293 mg/day, which is more than two times the tolerable upper intake level of sodium (UL) of 2,000 mg/day [1] . Additionally, according to that survey, approximately four out of five Korean adults consume sodium in amounts above the UL. Accordingly, sodium reduction is an urgent public health issue in South Korea.\n\n Considering the high number of consumers and excessive sodium intake at worksite cafeterias, targeting consumers of worksite cafeterias for sodium reduction would be an effective strategy for improving nutrition. Kim et al. [5] reported that approximately 3.4 million people per day consume a meal at worksite cafeterias, and this is the second largest group of people who use institutional food services in South Korea. When Min examined the sodium level per meal by the type of food service, worksite cafeteria meals had the highest mean sodium contents (2,236 mg/day/meal), followed by restaurant meals (1,959 mg/day/meal) and home-cooked meals (1,342 mg/day/ meal) [6] . Park reported that 10 food service cafeterias supplied 2,778 mg of sodium per meal on average [7] ; thus, the sodium content for even one meal was already over the sodium UL of 2,000 mg/day. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce sodium consumption at worksite cafeterias.\n\n The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has implemented a pilot project for sodium reduction at worksite cafeterias since May 2014 [8] . The participating worksite cafeterias gradually reduced the sodium contents of their meals from May to September 2014 [9] . The goal was to have reduced the sodium content of a daily meal to 1,300 mg by the end of September 2014. . The participating worksite cafeterias maintained 1,300 mg of sodium in each meal since October 2014. The worksite cafeterias could choose a sodium reduced meal as the alternative to a regular meal or as one of menu options. It is important to be aware of the consumers' opinions of the sodium-reduced diets.\n\n Many people believe that reducing sodium intake is challenging because they are exposed to cafeteria meals and processed foods, which are high in sodium. It is very important for consumers to have the choice of sodium-reduced diets and to provide nutrition labeling of menu items at cafeterias [4] . A thorough understanding of the factors related to consumers' choice of diet at worksite cafeterias would greatly help in successfully expanding this pilot project to the national level. Because very few studies have been conducted to examine the influencing factors related to sodium-reduced meal choice at worksite cafeterias, the researchers need to explore this in South Korea.\n\n Given the importance of consumer satisfaction, which likely influences the intake of a sodium-reduced meal, it is needed to clarify factors influencing consumer satisfaction for sodiumreduced meal. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between socio-demographic factors, consumer satisfaction, sodium awareness, barriers and the frequency of sodium-reduced meal intake. We also conducted the needs assessment of consumers to improve sodium-reduced meals.\n\n \n\n This study examined consumer satisfaction and awareness regarding sodium-reduced meal in 18 worksite cafeterias participating in the government pilot project [9] . Because a dietitian of one worksite refused to participate in this study, this research included 17 worksite cafeterias. In November 2014, the target population was Korean consumers 18 years or older in a cross-sectional study. Seventeen dietitians of each worksite cafeteria collected data from 50-60 consumers using convenience sampling.

Before the first case was registered in Nigeria on July 20, 2014, through an acutely ill traveler from Liberia who arrived at the international airport in Lagos, and was confirmed to have EVD after being admitted to a private hospital in Lagos, the entire world was already aware of the epidemic and equipped to handle it [5] . Although the index patient exposed about 72 people at the airport and the hospital to the virus, within hours of the confirmation of the disease, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health declared an Ebola emergency. This singular step helped mobilize all relevant resources to stop the epidemic earlier than anyone could imagine. It also allowed for prompt involvement of all relevant global bodies who contributed to the Nigerian success story, especially as the disease was already recognized by WHO as a public health emergency [6] .\n\n While the entire world -including Nigerian health officials were focusing on EVD, women and children were dying from malaria, measles, and other easily preventable communicable diseases. In some Nigerian states, funds earmarked for other health initiatives were diverted to EVD control processes to establish EVD EOC, train health workers as EVD control officers, as well as to acquire relevant personal protective equipment. In addition, fear of EVD in Nigeria led to the classical \"salt water and salt bath\" therapy which resulted in the hospitalization and or death of several people [7, 8] . However, this also highlighted the role of social media in public health and health education, which when properly harnessed could lead to enhanced health literacy, better health seeking behavior and improved public health outcomes. The national response enhanced port health, individual personal hygiene with proper hand washing practices and improved infection control practices in most hospitals which reduced nosocomial infections. Post-EVD outbreak, these practices were lost and Nigerians returned to usual practice prior to the outbreak. If public awareness was sustained, if hand hygiene could be linked to other diseases other than EVD alone, maybe the gains of the outbreak control program will not be completely lost.\n\n It is commendable that Nigeria was able to manage the imminent challenge very well. According to a local health magazine, the outbreak revealed that the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC): the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a rarity in Nigerian hospitals, whether publically or privately funded; the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (NFELTP): Nigerians prefer portable hand sanitizers because very few public hospitals have running water; functional state epidemiology units: and Nigerian authorities had not paid sufficient attention to infectious diseases outbreaks hitherto [9] . However, beyond these issues, lessons learned from EVD offer the portent for continuation of improved infection control practices, an interdisciplinary approach to healthcare and to integrated control of outbreaks, enhanced port health services and better personal hygiene. There is the hope that the higher index of suspicion among health workers, communities and non-governmental organizations will be maintained. Ebola is over for now in Nigeria, and there is continued decline in cases with Liberia yet to record a new case in more than 7days in March 2015 [10] . However, after EVD, what next?

Frequently, very mild and nonspecific symptoms make recognition of the contagion difficult. Without specific treatment, about 5-10% of symptomatic patients may die due to encephalomyelitis or severe cardiac failure (Moncayo 1992) . However, in the vast majority of patients this acute phase of the disease goes unrecognized because of the scarcity or absence of clinical manifestations.\n\n After 2-4 months the acute clinical manifestations disappear and the disease enters the chronic phase, generally starting with a long, asymptomatic clinical latency, which lasts 10-30 years or throughout life. In this phase, up to 30% of infected individuals develop at least one of the clinical forms of the disease: cardiomyopathy, and/ or megagastrointestinal syndromes, lacking effective treatment (Prata 2001) . From 50 to 70% of individuals remain asymptomatic and do not exhibit abnormalities in clinical studies (Tay et al. 1992 ). Chagas disease is confined to the Americas and ranks 4th according to World Health Organization (WHO 2002) priority diseases. It is the most frequent cause of cardiopathy in endemic areas, especially in rural areas in the Americas (UNDP 1990) .\n\n In Mexico, despite endemicity of T. cruzi parasites in vectors and reservoirs and the relatively high prevalence in humans, morbidity due to Chagas disease is not clear.\n\n In this work we report the results of the clinical characteristics in seropositive individuals to T. cruzi from the state of Puebla, Mexico, an area endemic for Chagas disease. Diagnosis of Chagas disease was made by two standardized serological tests using one autochthonous antigen from T. cruzi parasites by xenodiagnostics from a human host from the state of Puebla, Mexico and genetically characterized as HUM/ME/1997/MEX/RyCH1 (T. cruzi I).\n\n Study area -The study was conducted in the state of Puebla (Fig. 1) , which is located in the Southeast region of Mexico in a valley 1800 m above sea level and with a warm climate (average annual temperature 22\u00baC).

In this endemic area for Chagas disease, reported seroprevalence is 7.7% (Sanchez-Guill\u00e9n et al. 2002) .\n\n Subjects -We studied the seroprevalence in 2140 random blood samples from blood donors, evaluated for anti-T. cruzi antibodies, from the seven areas of the state of Puebla. We selected 166 individuals who were seropositive to both assays, i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and who were considered carriers of T. cruzi antibodies. Seventeen (10%) were included according to selection criteria (S\u00e1nchez-Guill\u00e9n et al. 2002) and 54 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with clinical data associated with chronic Chagas disease and who were seropositive to both assays (ELISA and IHA). Subjects were prospectively recruited from the Gastroenterology and Cardiology Services at Centro Medico Nacional Manuel Avila Camacho, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Puebla, Mexico. Among seropositive individuals, those with negative (1 of 2 tests) serology or seropositive to HIV (two individuals), VDRL, Brucella abortus (one individual), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), hepatitis B core antigen (HBc Ag) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (two individuals) tests were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were diagnosis of other chronic diseases or presence of contradictory findings from repeated examinations, refusal to participate (50 individuals) or due to difficulties as a result of rural location (94 individuals).\n\n Confirmatory diagnosis of Chagas disease was made in all patients on the basis of detection of circulating antibodies against T. cruzi antigens by two standardized serological tests according to the WHO (2002) .\n\n Clinical studies -All individuals enrolled were evaluated by a physician who administered an epidemiological questionnaire.

Right ventricular systolic pressure rose in 24 and the increase was greater in those under than over 5 years old. Pulmonary valve orifice area per square metre of body surface area increased in I2, did not change in 3, andfell in I7; absolute decrease in calculated orifice area was usually associated with infundibular hypertrophy. Increase in right ventricular systolic pressure with age was thus caused by failure of the valve orifice to grow fast enough to keep pace with the increase of stroke volume.\n\n In the whole group, increasingly severe pulmonary stenosis was matched by increasing electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. However, in individualpatients the electrocardiogram could suggest that right ventricular pressure had decreased when in fact it had risen considerably.\n\n Severe pulmonary stenosis may cause congestive heart failure and death in infancy or early childhood (Benton et al., I962; Luke, I966; Gersony et al., I967) . However, relatively few of those born with pulmonary stenosis follow this course (Carlgren, i959; Rowe and Cleary, I960; Lambert, Canent, and Hohn, I966) and the majority of deaths have occurred in older children and adults (Selzer et al., I949; Abrahams and Wood, i95i; Fabricius, i959) . Most of the reported older patients with severe pulmonary stenosis did not have serial cardiac catheterizations and we do not know if they had from infancy a tight stenosis that was well tolerated for many years, or if the obstruction was mild in infancy and became more severe with time.\n\n There have been few serial catheterization studies of the natural history of pulmonary stenosis in children and even fewer in very young children. Out of a total of I05 recatheterized patients cited in 8 reports (Fabricius, I959; Engle, Ito, and Goldberg, I964; Tinker et al., I965; Levine and Blumenthal, I965; Moller and Adams, I965; Loogan, Gleichmann, and Wilke, I966; Lueker, Vogel, and Blount, I970; M0ller, Wennevold, and Lyngborg, 1973) , the right ventricular pressure had risen significantly in Received 13 March 1975.

Furthermore, most of the patients were older children and adults; only I5 were under 5 years at the time of the first study and none were infants. The general lack of change of right ventricular pressure with time suggests that the pulmonary valve area increased with age in most of these patients, and this was confirmed by calculations of the valve area in 2 of these studies (Moller and Adams, I965; Lueker et al., I970) . While this information is important it does not throw any light on the changes occurring in the few with increasingly severe disease.\n\n There are several ways in which pulmonary stenosis might become more severe. Some studies (Kirklin et al., 1953; Johnson, I959;  Little, Lavender, and DeSanctis, I963) have suggested progressive obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract from increasing hypertrophy of infundibular muscle but these have all been in older children and adults. Campbell and Missen (I969) All had valvar pulmonary stenosis with an intact ventricular septum. Two with rubella embryopathy had added mild peripheral pulmonary arterial stenosis. Three had small left-to-right shunts with pulmonary to systemic flow ratios of I:8, 1:3, and I:2; one shunt was at the atrial level, one through a persistent ductus, and one at both levels.\n\n No sedation or anaesthesia was used for 8 infants catheterized under 3 months of age; I0 other infants received general anaesthesia(5) or sedationwithtribromoethyl alcohol (3), morphine sulphate (i), or chloral hydrate (i).", "qa": [["77_28919179_0_1", "What are the potential causes of increasingly severe pulmonary stenosis?\n", "Some studies suggest that progressive obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract from increasing hypertrophy of infundibular muscle may contribute to the worsening of pulmonary stenosis.

[6] [7] [8] [9] Moreover, the MYBs are often more specific in the genes and pathways they target compared with the bHLH and WDR components, which may be shared with MBW complexes regulating other processes (e.g., trichome formation). The mechanism for veinassociated pigmentation (venation) patterning is an excellent example of this, and has been determined in both Antirrhinum 10 and Petunia. 8 Anthocyanins accumulate in the epidermal cells overlaying the vasculature because this is where the expression domains of the MYB (transcript gradient from vasculature) and bHLH (epidermal) factors intersect. The mechanisms that establish developmentally regulated pigmentation patterns are not well understood (e.g., establishing \"petal spot\" identity 11, 12 ), but recent advances understanding the activity of the MBW complex may provide new insights. Theoretical models have been proposed that would allow the establishment of developmental patterns, which may have relevance for pigmentation patterning. 5 These models are based upon the diffusion of long-range inhibitors and activators with short-range activity, which act within a regulatory network that exhibits both reinforcement and feedback repression. [13] [14] [15] We have shown that in petunia, the gene network that regulates anthocyanin synthesis contains the components required to fulfil these models. 16 In particular, we demonstrated that the bHLH factor not only activates the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes (within MBW complex, to establish pigmentation), but also regulates its own expression (reinforcement) and that of genes encoding R3-MYB repressors. To fulfil the 2D patterning models proposed by Meinhardt and Gierer, 13, 14 these inhibitor R3-MYBs should be mobile and limit the activity of the activator (the bHLH, within the MBW activation complex). Our findings demonstrated that the pigmentation related R3-MYB and WDR proteins are indeed mobile within petal epidermal cells, while the R2R3-MYB activators, R2R3-MYB repressors, and bHLH proteins act cell-autonomously. Thus, the mobility of the R3-MYB and WDR proteins may be important for establishing or maintaining some pigmentation patterns. For example, petal spots are often surrounding by a halo of cells that are less pigmented than the rest of the petal. This suggests that either factors necessary for anthocyanin production are being depleted (WDR) or that inhibitory factors (R3-MYB) are being exported from the spot cells, or that a combination of both is occurring. 5 Such a mechanism would share significant similarity to that shown to regulate the development and distribution of trichomes in Arabidopsis leaves, where an MBW complex with reinforcement mechanisms and mobile WDR and R3-MYB repressors has shown to be involved. 13, 17 However, while this is the case for Arabidopsis, trichome regulation and distribution are not regulated by such MBW complexes in many plants. 18, 19 In contrast, the MBW complex has been found to be central to anthocyanin regulation in all higher plants examined to date. 5, 20, 21 Thus, it appears that the mechanisms that regulate anthocyanin synthesis are highly conserved in plants.\n\n The accumulated studies in Arabidopsis (a Rosid) and Petunia (an Asterid) have demonstrated the conservation of the key components of the MBW complex within Eudicots, including the R3-MYB and R2R3-MYB repressors. 16 We proposed a multi-species model for anthocyanin regulation that integrate hierarchy, reinforcement and feedback activity of the MBW gene regulation network. 16 This model now needs to be tested in diverse plant species, to identify both the elements of the gene regulation network that are functionally conserved, and differences that are specific to particular genera. It does appear that this network holds across the wider Angiosperm group, as similar MBW components have been identified in maize, lilies, and orchids, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] although the involvement of gene regulation networks and repressor proteins has not yet been demonstrated outside of the Eudicots. The lack of a non-grass monocot model species, with a sequenced genome and genetic resources, has limited the study of anthocyanin regulation within this important and diverse group of Angiosperms. Of particular interest are the Orchidaceae (Asparagales), because of the amazing diversity of floral patterning and specialized pollination strategies present within orchids. Taking into account the hierarchical nature of the MBW gene network, protein mobility and repressive activities may assist in understanding how complex and intricate patterns can form, such as those present in the flowers of orchids (Fig. 1A) .\n\n Some of the MBW components in Angiosperms have clearly either evolved for, or have been adapted for, control of pigmentation patterning in petals. So, if similar factors are present outside of Angiosperms do they fulfil equivalent roles when these lack flowers? At least some putative MBW components have been found in gymnosperms, specifically MBF1 from Picea mariana, 28 but data from outside of the Angiosperms is limited. Some commonalities in the production of anthocyanin pigments are evident between Eudicots and species as evolutionarily distant as the ferns, mosses, and liverworts. Both the environmental triggers for pigment induction and some of the patterning of pigmentation in vegetative tissues are strikingly similar across the entire range of plant groups. Such an example for patterning is the association of pigments with the veins of leaves (Fig. 1B) . Vegetative pigmentation preceded the evolution of flowers, so it is tempting to speculate that the mechanisms for venation of leaves and petals in the Angiosperms represents this more ancient character. 5, 8 To address this, further data are needed on the regulatory components, whether MBW or other proteins, in non-Angiosperm model species, such as the spikemoss Selaginella, the moss Physcomitrella, and the liverwort Marchantia.\n\n No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.", "qa": [["48_24572850_0_1", "How do MYB, bHLH, and WDR proteins contribute to pigmentation patterns in plants?", "MYB, bHLH, and WDR proteins are essential for activating anthocyanin synthesis and establishing pigmentation patterns in plants.
