It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required.

The pathophysiology of CTS is likely multifactorial but thought to be driven mainly by mechanical insult on the median nerve resulting from increased pressure within the carpal tunnel [2] .\n\n Electrophysiologically testing median nerve conduction has also been widely used for clinical diagnosis of CTS [3, 4] . When compared to healthy individuals, whose median nerve distal motor latency (DML) and sensory nerve latency (SNL) are generally less than 4.2 ms [5, 6 ] and 3.4 ms [6, 7] , respectively, patients with CTS classically present with prolonged median nerve DML [8] and SNL [9] .\n\n Median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) is commonly evaluated ultrasonographically as a means of diagnosing CTS [10, 11] . Median nerve CSA is considered abnormal when the CSA is > 9 mm 2 proximal to the carpal tunnel entry [12] , >10.03 mm 2 in the proximal carpal tunnel [13] or > 10.5 mm 2 at the level of pisiform bone [14] . In patients with CTS, increased median nerve CSA, specifically within the proximal segment of the carpal tunnel, is an indicator of pathological state of nerve swelling [15e17] .\n\n The median nerve is a mobile structure that stretches, compresses and translates in response to upper extremity motion. In healthy hands, the median nerve experiences sufficient excursion in response to hand motions to dissipate mechanical stress [18, 19] . In patients with CTS, mobility of the median nerve is commonly restricted which is indicative of nerve dysfunction [20e22] . Therapeutically, gliding exercises are used to improve impaired nerve mobility as a conservative intervention for CTS [23, 24] .\n\n Symptoms of CTS are commonly managed by conservative and/or surgical means. Conservative interventions for CTS include wrist splinting [25] , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [26] and corticosteroid injection [27] ; however, their effectiveness remains uncertain. Surgical treatment of CTS is performed by transecting the transverse carpal ligament. However, surgical release disrupts the anatomical, biomechanical and physiological functions of the carpal tunnel [28] and is associated with complications such as loss of grip strength, postoperative pillar pain [29] and symptom recurrence [30] .\n\n Recent studies have demonstrated a method to augment the carpal arch biomechanically as a way to decompress the median nerve [31, 32] . Geometric modelling [31] and in vitro studies [32] have showed that carpal arch width narrowing is associated with palmar bowing of the transverse carpal ligament, leading to increased arch height and area. Radioulnar wrist compression (RWC) increased the carpal arch area and lessened the flattening ratio of the median nerve in vivo [33, 34] , suggesting that the median nerve had been decompressed. However, it remains unknown how RWC improves the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of the median nerve in patients with CTS.\n\n The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 4 weeks of daily RWC on median nerve DML, SNL, CSA and longitudinal mobility in patients with CTS. It was hypothesized that RWC intervention would reduce median nerve DML and SNL, decrease median nerve CSA and increase median nerve longitudinal mobility in patients with CTS.\n\n \n\n Eleven patients (56.2 AE 12.3 years; 4 male and 7 female) clinically diagnosed with CTS voluntarily participated in this study, and the more affected hand of each participant was evaluated. Participants were recruited based on a history of paraesthesia, pain and/or numbness in the medianinnervated hand territory persisting for at least 3 months; at least one positive physical examination of Tinel's sign, Phalen's test or carpal compression test; a mean CTS severity score greater than 1.5 using the questionnaire [35] ; DML larger than 4.2 ms and SNL larger than 3.4 ms [6] .

The highest reported prevalence of chronic HCV is in Central Asia and the Middle East. Globally, Egypt has the highest prevalence of HCV, with some studies reporting HCV antibody positive rates of up to 15%, with an estimated 10% with chronic viremia (Fig. 2 ) [13, 14] . This high prevalence is partly due to treatment programs for schistosomiasis with unsterilized needles, which led to high rates of transmission of HCV [14] . As a result of iatrogenic exposure, and improperly sterilized medical equipment, the incidence of HCV in Egypt continues to be high [15] . One study estimated the incidence of new infections to be approximately 7/1000 patient-years, leading to approximately 500,000 new infections per year [16] . Intra-familial spread of HCV is also common in this region, however the specific practices leading to transmission are not well understood [17] .\n\n The largest population of HCV patients worldwide resides in East Asia and the Indian subcontinent, with at least 100 million HCV positive individuals in this region [15, 18] . HCV prevalence rates in South and East Asia range from 0.6% in China to 4.9% in Pakistan [19, 20] . Iatrogenic exposure, through infected blood products or medical procedures with contaminated needles, continues to be the major mechanism of transmission of HCV in these countries [19] . However, injection drug use (IDU) is becoming an increasingly important route of transmission [21] .\n\n The prevalence of HCV in North America and Western Europe is comparatively lower. HCV transmission in Europe and North America is predominantly through IDU [22, 23] . At least 7.3 million people (1.1%) are estimated to be living with HCV in Europe [24, 25] . Estimates suggest that 5.2 million people are anti-HCV positive in the United States [26] . These figures likely underestimate the true prevalence in both regions [26] . The implementation of blood product screening and proper disposal and sterilization of medical waste has led to a decline in the incidence of HCV in both regions [27] . In the USA, HCV incidence dropped from an estimated 7.4/100,000 people in 1982-89 to 0.7/100,000 in 1994-2006. In contrast with the developing world, iatrogenic outbreaks in North America and Western Europe are uncommon, and are typically confined to individual clinics using improper sterilization technique [28] .\n\n These data reveal large differences in the prevalence of these chronic liver diseases among migrant groups and the host nations. In an era of increasing migration, these differences in HBV and HCV prevalence between regions have important implications for public health agencies in host nations.\n\n With the growing ease of air travel, and the globalization of the world economy, mass migration has been on the upswing in the last half of the 20th century. According to UN estimates, the total number of international migrants in 2013 was 231.5 million, making this group larger than the 5th most populous nation [29] . In 1990, 154 million people, or 2.9% of the global population were migrants, whereas the corresponding figure for 2013 was 3.2% [30] . These numbers do not include undocumented migrants or trafficked persons, and therefore likely underestimate the global migrant population. Many of these migrants move into and remain part of ethnic minority groups where traditional social and cultural behaviors that may have adverse implications for exposure to HBV and HCV are reinforced and persist.\n\n In 2013, the United States, Canada and four EU states (Germany, UK, France and Spain) were among the top 10 destinations for international migrants [30] . The EU was home to 72 million foreign-born migrants in 2013, while the US alone was home to 45 million migrants. Refugees accounted for 7% (15.7 million) of the global migrant stock in 2013 [29] .\n\n Migration to EU and North America occurs mainly from countries with high prevalence of viral hepatitis.

Only pooled data are shown on the graphs where observed medians, interquartile ranges, and the adjacent values are shown and outside values individually plotted ( Fig. 1) . Adjacent values are formally defined as three-halves of the interquartile range rolled back to where data persist; they run the length of the whisker. Outside values are more extreme than the adjacent values.\n\n The pituitary gland is an exquisitely sensitive monitor of circulating FT 4 because there is an inverse log/linear relation between TSH and FT 4 [6] . TSH has been shown to be an adequate initial, sole screening test for thyroid disease [7] .\n\n Age-dependent reference intervals have previously been used for TSH [8] , but more recent work has shown that although there are minor variations in both TSH and FT 4 values as between younger and older adults, the limits of the variation lie within the accepted reference intervals (TSH 0.5-5.0 mU/L and FT 4 9 -24 pmol/L) (Ciba Corning Diagnostics, assay kit insert data) and should not Clinical Chemistry 43, No. 11, 1997 result in diagnostic algorithms needing modification on an age-dependent basis [9] . This cross-sectional study confirms and redefines these findings.\n\n In the population studied here TSH does not vary with age (ANOCOVA, F \u03fe0.885). Nelson et al. [10] studied the complex FT 4 -TSH interplay in infants, children, and younger adults to age 45 years. They found that an adult plateau in TSH concentrations is reached at age 31 years. Our numbers in the age groups \u03fd20 years are too few to compare with Nelson's work but thereafter would suggest that the adult plateau has been reached by as early as 20 years of age. From age 20 to 80 years our findings probably concur with those of Hershman et al. [11] . They compared geometric mean TSH (and 95% CI) in 216 persons \u03fe70 years of age with 211 of their offspring, ages 40 -60 years. They do not give any more detail as to the age composition. Their results and ours for the older group are 1.24 (0.29 -5.40) and 1.32 (1.15-1.52), and for the younger 1.45 (0.54 -3.90) and 1.41 (1.17-1.68) mU/L, respectively. The results are statistically indistinguishable, although it should be noted that our greater subject numbers produce much narrower CIs. When age is treated as a continuous variable, we find no difference between the results of men and women (ANOCOVA, F \u03fe0.883), nor is there any interaction between age and gender (F \u03fe0.846). In the 40 -44 years age group there is a statistically significant difference (mean \u03ee SD 0.99 \u03ee 2.11 vs 2.31 \u03ee 2.67, P \u03fd0.039), but this is considered to be a sampling phenomenon only. No difference is seen in any of the other categorical age groupings.\n\n Visual inspection of the graphed TSH data suggests that from age 80 years and up, TSH concentrations decline, and although the TSH mean (\u03eeSD) from age 80 years (0.88 \u03ee 3.32 mU/L) does not differ from the mean found through the 20 -79 years of age adult plateau (1.61 \u03ee 2.23 mU/L), the difference approaches significance (P \u03fd0.079). This is partly in agreement with Hersh- man et al. [11] , whose older women had slightly lower TSH values than their younger offspring (1.21 vs 1.52 mU/L, P \u03fd0.05).

Although antibody TF8-llD12 was previously reported to inhibit the procoagulant activity of T F strongly,14 the data presented above indicate it has no effect on the affinity of FVIIa for wild-type TF, nor does it inhibit TF cofactor function as measured by enhancement of FVIIa amidolytic activity. To examine this apparent discrepancy further, the effect of TF8-llD12 on the rate of activation of FX and FIX, two natural macromolecular substrates for TF.FVIIa, was examined. TF8-llD12 IgG abolished formation of FXa by the S T F~.~~~: F V I I~ complex, whereas a control IgG at the same concentration had no effect (Fig 4A) . Antibody TF9-9C3 also blocked activation of FX (data not shown), which is consistent with the ability to block binding of FVIIa to TF demonstrated above. TF8-llD12 treatment of relipidated, wild-type TF similarly abolished FX activation (data not shown). In addition, incubation of TF with Fab fragments of TF8-11D12 also abolished FX activation, except that the concentration of half-maximal inhibition by the Fab was 10-fold higher than by the intact IgG (data not shown).\n\n The TF:FVIIa complex has been shown to activate FIX as well as FX,33 but the ability of the S T F~.~~~: F V I I~ complex to activate FIX has not previously been reported.

The second TF9-9C3. stage was modified after Griffith et a1,26 in which quenched timed samples were incubated with polylysine (which serves as a synthetic cofactor for FIXa), FX, and chromogenic FXa substrate. TF8-llD12 IgG or Fab completely blocked FIXa generation, as did TF9-9C3, whereas the negative control antibody was without effect (Fig 4B) .\n\n Antibody inhibition of FWI autoactivation. The ability of antibody TF8-llD12 to inhibit FVII autoactivation was examined by preincubating relipidated TF with IgG, then adding a mixture of *251-FVII (25 nmol/L final concentration) and unlabeled FVIIa (5 nmol/L final concentration). At various times samples were removed, quenched, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to visualize the TF-mediated conversion of single-chain lZ5I-FVII to two-chain lZI-FVIIa (Fig 5) . Preincubation of TF with either TF9-9C3 or TF8-llD12 significantly reduced the observed rate of lZI-FVII activation from 11.4%/min with no added antibody to 0.17%/min and 1.12%/min for TF9-9C3 and TF8-11D12, respectively. The use of an irrelevant antibody (HPC4) as a negative control had comparatively little effect (6.3% /min).\n\n In a previous study characterizing a panel of 24 monoclonal antibodies, all but one of the antibodies were found to inhibit the clotting activity of TF, as well as to inhibit specific binding of lZ5I-FVII to 582 ~e1ls.l~ It was therefore concluded that the inhibitory antibodies blocked association of FVII(a) with TF.14 In this study, we have demonstrated that, surprisingly, the inhibitory antibody TF8-llD12 did not diminish TF cofactor function as measured by enhancement of the amidolytic activity of FVIIa toward a small peptide substrate or by enhancement of reactivity of FVIIa toward a peptidyl-chloromethylketone inhibitor.

The Department of Health requires reductions in MRSA bacteraemia rates in hospital by 60%. 6 To decide where to target interventions for infection control, we surveyed the epidemiology of MRSA and methicillin sensitive S aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia in two Oxfordshire hospitals over a seven year period.\n\n \n\n Our study involved the John Radcliffe, Radcliffe Infirmary, and Churchill Hospitals, which operate together as one acute care teaching hospital in Oxford, also offering specialist regional services including cardiothoracic and neurosurgery, and nephrology. The Horton Hospital is a district general hospital in Banbury, 30 miles (48 km) further north. Together, they provide all acute clinical and bacteriology services to a catchment area of about 600 000 people.\n\n Our first study was done in the seven years to 31 March 2004 in the Oxford hospitals. To confirm our observations from the Oxford site we performed a second study over the five years to 31 March 2004 in the Banbury hospital. These timings were chosen to coincide with financial years. Patient administration system (PAS) data were available for three months before the start of the study in both hospitals. We were unable to study the Horton Hospital for exactly the same period as the Oxford hospitals because of differences in administration systems between the two sites before 1999. Figure 1 shows the durations of the study and the sources of data.\n\n Data were anonymised with routines written in Visual FoxPro 8 (Microsoft) with the Crypt 2 ActiveX plug-in (Chilkat Software, http://www.chilkatsoft.com), by transforming hospital number, NHS number, and name and date of birth into code numbers with a salted MD5 hash function, which is an irreversible step. To allow calculation of age, we recorded the month of birth of each case.\n\n We devised and tested a method of linking anonymised hospital microbiology results, general practice microbiology results, and patient activity data, based on clustering results sharing hospital numbers, NHS numbers, and combinations of surname, first initial, and date of birth. All hospital activity data from the patient administration system could be linked, but a small number of microbiology samples could not. Of the 802 036 specimens from which S aureus could be cultured, we excluded 5864 (0.7%) because they lacked any adequate identifiers to make links. Among the 96 463 blood cultures analysed, we excluded 105 (0.1%) because of inadequate identifiers.\n\n We used nationally recognised admission specialty codes to group cases. The patient administration system records each epi-sode of admission to hospital, including admissions for haemodialysis and day care, as well as longer admissions. To simplify analysis, we grouped some specialties, based on similar activity, as follows: surgical specialties except trauma (codes 100-110, 150, 160, 170, 171); otorhinolaryngology, eye, and oral surgery (120, 130, 140); haematology and oncology (303, 370, 800); medical specialties (300, 301, 302, 330, 340, 350); paediatrics (400-420), and obstetrics and gynaecology (500, 501, 502, 560, 610).

The main pharmacological and clinical data pertinent to romosozumab are summarized in Table 2 .\n\n As a whole, this monoclonal antibody against sclerostin increases bone formation, decreases bone resorption and lowers the risk of vertebral and clinical fractures in postmenopausal OP women. Theoretically, it could be employed also in renal patients, but no pharmacokinetics data are available in the presence of reduced GFR. Its specific anti-sclerostin action points to a useful employment in particular in cases with adynamic bone disease.\n\n Another aspect to consider when dealing with this drug is the possibility of extra-skeletal effects, in particular on vascular calcification. Clinical observations in hemodialysis patients showed higher serum sclerostin levels in those with aortic valve calcifications and upregulated sclerostin mRNA expression in calcified aortic valves explanted for clinical indications [61] . Similarly, in end-stage renal patients at time of transplantation, serum sclerostin correlated positively with vascular calcifications, but tissue expression of sclerostin was not evident in calcified epigastric arteries [62] . We can speculate that higher circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with osteoblast inhibition and low bone turnover, and, hence, with vascular calcifications. Alternatively, increased tissue levels could inhibit calcification by inhibiting activity and trans-differentiation of the osteoblast-like cells (i.e. calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells) responsible for calcification. Therefore, the final effect of sclerostin inhibition with romosozumab on vascular calcification is not predictable. Its anabolic effect on adynamic bone could improve calcium and phosphate balance and then vascular calcification, while local reduction could favor it. In any case, romosozumab by interacting systemically and/or locally with the RANK/RANKL/ OPG system and the Wnt pathway could definitely affect vascular calcifications and mortality [61, 63] . Accordingly, the link between vascular calcification and romosozumab therapy must be regarded as a new, still unexplored, field of clinical research.\n\n Teriparatide, denosumab and romosozumab are very new drugs for the nephrologist. They modify the activity of the individual bone cells and can drive their normally coupled activity toward different balances. Nephrologists should quickly learn if and how to employ them in specific ROD types. Specifically, since the most frequent bone lesion described in CKD-5D patients is low turnover bone and since we can generally cure high turnover bone through medical or surgical therapy, a \"wish come true\" trial could focus attention on adynamic bone disease. One could propose an ideal prospective randomized trial exploring hard outcomes (fractures, vascular calcifications and cardiovascular mortality) in incident dialysis patients with bone biopsy-proven adynamic bone and randomized to standard therapies (placebo) or teriparatide for 1 year, followed by denosumab for a second year. Alternatively, also romosozumab could be employed, but we lack any available clinical evidence for its use in renal patients.\n\n Bone disease in renal patients has now clearly become transformed into a complex bone endocrinopathy at the heart of CKD-MBD, with a significant potential link to cardiovascular disease. The new biologicals established for OP have direct effects on the activity of bone cells with effects that could be tailored for the treatment of some specific ROD types. However, the evaluation of systemic effects is also warranted, given the complexity of bone disease in renal failure.", "qa": [["16_5373427_8_1", "How does romosozumab affect bone formation and resorption in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis?", "Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody against sclerostin, increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

[1] , the quality of life is how good a life each individual feels he or she has. Each individual personally evaluates how he or she views things and his or her feelings and notions. Whether an individual is content with life and happy are aspects that reflect the subjective quality of life [1] .\n\n With evolution from a focus on reducing mortality to reducing disability due to chronic diseases, there is a need for methods of measuring the effect of chronic diseases on health status, which is more complicated than simply measuring how often the diseases cause death [2] . Therefore, developing valid and reliable methods for assessing the relative impact and distinguishing between chronic diseases is important when establishing program priorities and for estimating the cost and burden that various diseases present [3] . Quality of life is an important indicator in assessing the burden of disease especially for chronic conditions.\n\n The Health Utilities Index (HUI) is based on the Comprehensive Health Status Measurement System (CHSMS) and a generic multiattribute preference-based measure of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) that is widely used as an outcome measure in clinical studies, in population health surveys, in the estimation of quality-adjusted life years, and in economic evaluations [4] . It provides a description of an individual's overall functional health based on eight attributes: vision, hearing, speech, mobility (ability to get around), dexterity (use of hands and fingers), cognition (memory and thinking), emotion (feelings), and pain/discomfort [5] .\n\n The HUI is able to synthesize both quantitative and qualitative aspects of health. It is a family of generic health status and HRQL measures, including the HUI Mark 1 (HUI1), Mark 2 (HUI2), and Mark 3 (HUI3), which are frequently used both in clinical and population health studies in many countries, including Canada [6] . The HUI3 has two components: (1) the health status classification system and (2) the preference-based scoring system [7, 8] .\n\n In addition, in describing the functional health status levels, the HUI3 has a single numerical value for any possible combination of levels of the eight self-reported health attributes. The HUI3 maps any one of the vectors of the eight health attribute levels into a summary health value between -0.36 and 1.00. On that scale, the most preferred health level (perfect health) is rated 1.00 and death is rated 0.00, while negative scores reflect health states considered worse than death. The HUI3 was developed by McMaster University's Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis and is derived using societal preferences from a random sample of 500 people within the boundaries of the City of Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario, Canada [9] . The scores of the HUI embody the views of society concerning health status. These views are termed societal preferences, since preferences about various health states are elicited from a representative sample of individuals.\n\n This project is of interest to analysts, policy makers, and decision makers involved with descriptive clinical studies, clinical trials, programed evaluations, measuring population health, and planning assessments. To use the HUI to measure the quality of life for the individuals with poorer HRQL than the general population and to identify the possibility of associations between HUI system and various chronic conditions may provide information to improve the management of quality of life for chronic diseases in Canada.\n\n The study was based on the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for 2000-01 [10] , which was conducted by Statistics Canada, Health Canada, and the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) to provide regular and timely cross-sectional estimates of health determinants, health status, and health system utilization for 136 health regions across the country, with a total sample of 130,880. The target population of the CCHS included all household residents 12 years of age and over in all provinces and territories; with the principal exclusion of populations on Indian Reserves, Canadian Forces Bases, and some remote areas. As with other Statistics Canada surveys, the results of this survey will aid in the development of public policy, help in the understanding of the determinants of health, and increase understanding of the relationship between health status and health care utilization. This method was used to estimate graphical and adjusted distributions of the prevalence for various chronic diseases and the HUI3 scores, in order to measure the quality of life for individuals living with various chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, COPD, stroke, cataracts, cancer, glaucoma, and renal diseases).", "qa": [["84_40060905_0_1", "How does the Health Utilities Index (HUI) contribute to the assessment of quality of life for individuals with chronic diseases?", "The Health Utilities Index (HUI) is a generic multiattribute preference-based measure of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

However, the SI from enhancing meninges in sulcal spaces along cerebral convexities is not unequivocally distinguishable from vascular enhancement on PCT1W, leading to the lower accuracy of PCT1W as also seen in other previous studies [3, 12] . Better accuracy of PCFLAIR in infectious meningitis can further be explained by increased leakage of contrast from pial vessels into adjacent CSF from acutely inflamed meninges. Splendiani et al., [11] found the overall sensitivity of enhanced FLAIR sequence to be 100% while Parmar et al., [13] found it to be 85%. In the study by Kremer et al., [12] , the accuracy in various leptomeningeal diseases including meningitis was 90%. Singh et al., [16] and Galassi et al., [18] have reported contrast enhanced PCTW1 with FS to be superior to contrast enhanced FLAIR imaging in leptomeningeal diseases. However, these studies were not limited to infectious meningitis and included other leptomeningeal pathologies like metastatic disease and chronic infections. Galassi et al., studied their patients by alternating FLAIR and PCTIW with FS as the first acquired sequence. In cases of metastatic disease and chronic infections, the meninges are both thickened and show increased vascularity. Contrast remaining in blood pool in such leptomeningeal diseases explains better enhancement and sensitivity of PCTIW in above studies while in infectious meningitis, both vascular congestion and subarachnoid leakage contribute to better enhancement on PCFLAIR [18] .\n\n A major challenge lies in the detection of subtle meningeal enhancement in cases of viral meningitis. Being a hill state, viral meningitis forms a substantial subset of patients referred to our institute. A few studies have described the importance of PCFLAIR in suspecting viral meningitis even before CSF cytology and cultures are available to the clinician but the strong distinctive comparative advantage of PCFLAIR (70% accuracy) compared to PCT1W (0% accuracy) in early detection of such cases has not been reported yet. The effectiveness of PCFLAIR in viral meningitis is also better than reported previously for post contrast magnetization transfer spin-echo T1 sequence. We found that the early detection of viral meningitis using PCFLAIR adds to the confidence of clinician and may lead to initiation of prompt therapeutic trial and better clinical prognosis. This may avoid empirical treatment of viral meningitis [3, 11, 13, 20, 21] .\n\n The possible elimination of vascular enhancement component on PCFLAIR has been observed previously [7, 11, 12, 14] . However, to the best of our knowledge we have not come across any study which has made a quantitative evaluation of the vascular and meningeal components of enhancement in cases of meningitis. By using quantitative measurements, we have tried to statistically prove our qualitative observations regarding the relative advantages of PCFLAIR in detection of early and subtle cases of infectious meningitis especially those of viral origin. Vascular and meningeal enhancements on T1-weighted sequence were quantitatively proven to be significantly greater than that for FLAIR sequence due to T1 shortening effect. However, on FLAIR sequence, the net leptomeningeal enhancement was significantly greater compared to PCT1W. This is responsible for unequivocal visual appreciation of meningeal enhancement on PCFLAIR as observed qualitatively. It was also substantiated that in tubercular meningitis, the average basal enhancement was significantly more than leptomeningeal enhancement as reported previously [3, 22] .\n\n The limitations of FLAIR sequence are related to slight increase in duration of the MR study by about one minute. Longer effective TE and CSF flow artefacts can sometimes lead to hyperintense sulci especially in children on pre-contrast FLAIR and may make distinction of post contrast meningeal enhancement difficult. Using a lower TE in our study eliminated these shortcomings and shortened the duration of study. Occasionally, the high signal in subarachnoid space is found in different conditions other than meningitis like subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, in patients who have received supplemental oxygen, gadolinium or iodinated contrast in the previous week or general anesthesia [15, 16, [22] [23] [24] . Such cases were excluded from our study and can even be ruled out by appropriate clinical evaluation. Simple SPSI may have some intra and interobserver variations. We tried to minimize it by using customized co-registration software so that SPSI at same table positions are obtained. Since SPSI was just used to substantiate the qualitative observations, use of this tool did not have any major disadvantage in the present study. As a part of single imaging study protocol, it was not possible to compare PCFLAIR with various other modifications of conventional T1 sequences like post-contrast T1 magnetization transfer imaging [21] . However, this sequence also has the same limitations of T1-weighted sequences described earlier [18, 25] . In addition, using 3D FLAIR instead of 2D FLAIR may reduce CSF flow artifacts [17] and improve the specificity of detection of meningeal enhancement. However, 3D FLAIR is not routinely available on all scanners and substantially increases the imaging time also. Multiinstitutional trials with larger study population are required to develop the best imaging protocol in infectious meningitis.\n\n PCFLAIR sequence is a very useful sequence in early detection of infectious meningitis especially of viral etiology due to its ability to unequivocally differentiate meningeal enhancement from vascular enhancement.", "qa": [["84_24118416_2_1", "What are the advantages of using PCFLAIR sequence in the detection of infectious meningitis?\n", "The PCFLAIR sequence has several advantages in the detection of infectious meningitis.

This is mostly due to a weakened immunity [1] which leads to a higher case fatality rate even under the standard treatment guidelines [2] . To improve and maintain better nutritional status, the World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged the use of Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) for community-based treatment of severe undernutrition [3, 4] . RUTF is energydense lipid paste made of peanut butter, milk powder, oil, sugar, minerals, vitamin, and protein mix [5] .\n\n Among RUTF-treated children, severe undernutrition status can be improved among hospitalized antiretroviral therapy (ART) na\u00efve HIV-positive children [6] . Compared with HIV-negative children, the case fatality rate is higher among hospitalized ART na\u00efve HIV-positive children [7, 8] ; however, community-based RUTF treatment of the ART-na\u00efve HIV-positive children, particularly with severe undernutrition without complications, is known to be associated with a better survival [9] .\n\n The combination of RUTF and ART treatments might improve undernutrition and reduce case fatality rates among HIV-positive children. This is because ART improves immunity, reduces energy loss, and may improve child's appetite to food [10] [11] [12] . So far, only a handful of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of each intervention separately and only one has shown that the initiation of RUTF and ART may improve wasting status among HIV-positive children [13] . In this study, prompt initiation of ART among patients treated with RUTF was associated with weight gain. However, this study focused on wasting alone and the association of RUTF treatment duration and nutrition statuses were not examined.\n\n Tanzania is one of the countries hardest hit by both HIV/AIDS and child undernutrition. In 2009, HIV prevalence was 5.9% in Tanzania [14] . In the general population, 47.8% of children are stunted, 24.5% are underweight, and more than 4.5% are wasted [15] . ART program has been expanded in Tanzania [14] . However, ART-treated, HIVpositive children continue to suffer from underweight and wasting [16] . For example, 22.1% and 13.6% of ARTtreated, HIV-positive children were underweight and wasted, respectively, in Dar es Salaam [16] .\n\n To ameliorate such high undernutrition rate, Ministry of Health and other development partners established the RUTF intervention in selected HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Centers (CTCs) as a pilot intervention in Tanzania. Although studies among ART na\u00efve populations showed effectiveness of RUTF, we could not find similar studies among ART-treated children elsewhere. Furthermore, since the start of RUTF intervention as a pilot project in Tanzania, no studies have evaluated its efficacy among ART-treated HIV-positive children. Therefore, we conducted this study to examine the association of RUTF intervention with stunting, wasting, and underweight statuses among the ART-treated, HIV-positive children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n\n We conducted this cross sectional study in Dar es Salaam, where HIV prevalence was 8.9% in 2009. It accounts for about 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. The city has 44 HIV/AIDS care and treatment centers (CTCs) which provide ART programs to care about 4,000 children [14] .\n\n Participants of this study included pairs of 219 underfive ART-treated, HIV-positive children and their caregivers. These children were attending CTCs that provide RUTF treatment to severe undernourished children. In Dar es Salaam, a total of six out of 44 CTCs provide RUTF to such children. We excluded the CTC of the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). MNH is the referral center for complicated cases from the Northern zone and beyond. Being the highest tertiary hospital, its CTC also cares for more complicated and severe cases from the outside of the region. As a result, we selected five CTCs: Amana, Temeke, Mwananyamala, IDC, and Pasada CTCs. Children under five years of age in the selected CTCs totaled 1719. Amana CTC registered 350 children, Temeke CTC 396, IDC 250, Pasada 373, and Mwananyamala 350.\n\n Of the total, about 58% of the children enrolled in CTCs were on ART. We excluded children with missing medical and ART-related information and those whose parents did not consent to participate in the study.

The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide over the past few decades, especially among women. [1] [2] [3] By 2030, if these recent trends are maintained, thyroid cancer will be the fourth most common cancer. 4 Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common histological type of thyroid cancer, accounting for over 90% of all thyroid malignancies. 5 Most PTC patients have good prognoses, with a 10-year survival rate exceeding 95%. [5] [6] [7] Nevertheless, the incidence of lymph node metastasis can be as high as 20-50%, 8 and PTC patients undergoing total thyroidectomy have a regional recurrence rate of 5-20%. 9 Without therapeutic options, these patients have poor prognoses. [10] [11] [12] Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanisms and genetic alterations of PTC are imperative and necessary for thyroid carcinoma. Metabolic changes are thought to play an important role in tumor development. Otto Warburg found that cancer cells prefer to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) by glycolysis rather than by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) even in the presence of ample oxygen. 13, 14 This finding was later termed the Warburg effect. The recent discovery of mutations targeting metabolic genes in cancer has generated a renewed interest in cancer metabolism. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDHs include 3 members: IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3. IDH1 is located in the cytosol and the peroxisomes, while IDH2 and IDH3 are located in the mitochondria. 15, 16 IDH2 mutations confer a gain-of-function, and lead to neomorphic enzymatic activity. 17 Wild-type IDH2 catalyzes isocitrate to produce alpha-ketogluatarate (\u03b1-KG) and NADPH/CO 2 , and the mutant IDH2 catalyzes alpha-ketogluatarate to produce beta-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 18, 19 Supra-normal levels of intracellular 2-HG lead to hypermethylation of target genes, which in turn blocks cellular differentiation. 20, 21 In 2009, a mutation in the IDH2 gene at position R172 was first discovered in patients with gliomas, including astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. 22 Subsequently, R140 mutations were found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 17, 19 To date, IDH2 mutants have been detected in several malignancies. 23, 24 However, research on IDH2 has primarily focused on its mutation mechanism and clinical significance, and there are very few studies on the function of wild-type IDH2. In addition, the IDH2 gene was examined for mutations in thyroid cancer, but no mutations were found in thyroid cancer. 25 The alteration of wild-type IDH2 levels has been identified in several types of carcinomas. Wild-type IDH2 has been shown to be overexpressed in testicular and prostate cancers, 26 endometrial cancer, 27 and Kashin-Beck disease. 28 In contrast, wild-type IDH2 is downregulated in gastric cancer (GC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and patients with low IDH2 demonstrated a lower 5-year survival rate. 29, 30 However, the significance of IDH2 expression in thyroid cancer is still unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of key metabolic-related enzymes in thyroid cancer and adjacent normal tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We first investigated the expression of IDH2 in thyroid cancer tissues and compared it with its expression in adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, using frozen tissues. The relationship between IDH2 and the clinicopathological features of thyroid cancer was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, we investigated the function of wild-type IDH2 in thyroid cancer cells by inhibiting or overexpressing IDH2 via plasmid transfection in in vitro experiments. Our results indicated that IDH2 may play an important role in the development of thyroid cancer. IDH2 can be used as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis and may be a potential therapeutic target for thyroid cancer.\n\n \n\n All tissue samples were taken with informed consent of the patient.

An increased understanding of potentially important molecular targets and signalling pathways involved in driving cancer has led to the development of novel therapeutics, which can be combined with RT to potentially improve tumour control and outcomes further (Bernier et al, 2004) . One potential target is Akt, which is at the centre of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, known to have diverse cellular functions including those of survival, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, glucose uptake and cellular metabolism (Cantley, 2002) . Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a prominent feature of many human cancers, and overexpression of the phosphorylated form of Akt has been shown to be associated with radioresistance and local recurrence (Gupta et al, 2002) .\n\n Several potential mechanisms have been described by which Akt is involved in the response of tumours to RT suggesting the combination of RT with Akt inhibition may be an important therapeutic opportunity (Kim et al, 2006; Bussink et al, 2008; Schuurbiers et al, 2009) . It has been demonstrated that inhibitors of the Akt pathway can increase the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumour cells (Kim et al, 2005) . Akt is also known to impact on the tumour microenvironment and to induce hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, which in turn can affect the tumour vasculature and tumour response to RT (Kao et al, 2007; Jiang & Liu, 2009; Fokas et al, 2012) .\n\n A number of potent inhibitors of Akt have recently entered clinical development. One such compound, AZD5363, is an orally bioavailable, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive inhibitor of all three isoforms of Akt. AZD5363 is an attractive candidate as an adjuvant to RT as the drug has successfully completed phase I trial investigation with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile (Banerji et al, 2013) . In this study, we have evaluated whether AZD5363 in combination with RT could improve tumour control.\n\n We have investigated the potential of AZD5363 to radiosensitise cancer cells in vitro and increase tumour control after RT in vivo in two tumour models of head and neck cancer (FaDu and PE/CA PJ34). This has included establishing the optimal scheduling of AZD5363 and RT in order to maximise the efficacy of the combination.\n\n We have further investigated mechanistically the effects of AZD5363 in combination with RT on the tumour microenvironment. Specifically, we have studied the effect of AZD5363 on the levels of pro-angiogenic proteins VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) and the subsequent impact of any alteration on tumour vascularity and oxygenation. In addition, we have considered the potential effect of AZD5363 on tumour vasculogenesis after RT and on vascular endothelial cell radiosensitivity and proliferation.\n\n These data collectively provide a strong case for the continued development of AZD5363 as a potential adjuvant to improve outcomes after RT. The study also provides potentially important proof of principle scheduling data to inform early phase clinical trial design.\n\n \n\n It is known that Akt inhibition can alter the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumour cells (Kim et al, 2005) ; therefore, we evaluated the effect of AZD5363 on a variety of cell lines in vitro. AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of Akt and led to reductions in the levels of phosphorylated Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK3b) and the phosphorylated downstream pathway S6 ribosomal protein (pS6) detectable by Western blot in all cell lines (Fig 1A, and Appendix Fig S1A and B) .", "qa": [["22_11325740_0_1", "How does Akt inhibition affect the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumor cells?\n", "Akt inhibition can alter the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumor cells.

This likely resulted in an increased frequency of ZIKV activity every 1 to 2 years when compared with other arboviruses, which exhibit an activity frequency of 5 to 8 years for dengue virus and yellow fever virus. 36 The unique genomic features of ZIKV likely contributed to the rapid emergence of the virus over a very large geographic area. Very little is currently known about the biology and pathogenesis of ZIKV. The envelope protein for flaviviruses is largely responsible for host range due to receptor binding and immune responses. The ZIKV envelope gene underwent several selective changes mainly associated with negative selection, implying an important role for this gene in vertebrate host selectivity and emergence. 36 Acute ZIKV infection in 6 human cases was characterized by robust, acute polyclonal T-cell activation and acute increases in serum interleukin (IL) responses (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-17). 39 Also, acute infection in these patients was associated with increases in RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor. 39 These data provide some initial information to characterize the acute inflammatory response in these patients. Cell culture and mouse models of ZIKV are not well established at this stage. Recent data have shown that human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, human neurospheres, 40 and immature dendritic cells are permissive to recent ZIKV isolates and that several entry or adhesion factors (DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3, and TIM-1) permitted ZIKV entry, implying that the virus can use a range of host receptors to gain entry into different cell types. 41 During acute infection in cell culture, ZIKV induced transcription of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) as well as several common interferon-stimulated genes, implying that the innate immune response found to be important for control of other flaviviruses also plays an important role in the detection and control of ZIKV. 41 Zika virus was also sensitive to type I and II interferons in these cell culture systems. 41 These data are consistent with what is known about other flaviviruses and help to characterize the role of the immune response for this virus. A better understanding of the mechanisms of immune control of ZIKV will enable targeted vaccination or therapeutic treatments in the future. A recent mouse model of ZIKV brain infection was developed in interferon signaling-deficient mice. 42 Work with classic ZIKV isolates in suckling mice revealed neurotropism and 100% mortality by day 10 following intracerebral injection. 3, [43] [44] [45] These studies revealed neuronal injury especially in the hippocampus characterized by astrocyte activation and new virions on ultrastructural examination in networks of the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons. 43 Adult mice in these studies seemed to be more resistant to peripheral infection with ZIKV but did develop neurologic disease following intracerebral infection. 44 Further development of animal models for modern ZIKV isolates is needed to understand the complex pathogenesis and immune responses required to prevent disease.\n\n Zika virus has rapidly emerged throughout the 20th century and now is causing a large epidemic of disease in the Americas that has concerning links to possible intrauterine infection of the brains of developing fetuses. There is no current therapy or vaccine for this infection and the best approach to avoid complications from ZIKV is to avoid exposure to mosquitoes by using insect repellant, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and using air conditioning and window screens to keep mosquitoes outside. For women traveling to regions undergoing a current outbreak of ZIKV, cautions must be undertaken in the case of pregnancy as outlined by the CDC. 46 For men and women living in the endemic region of the ZIKV outbreak, we need urgent solutions and study of this virus to produce interventions that can prevent birth defects now linked with acute ZIKV infection in pregnant women.", "qa": [["21_25503965_2_1", "What are the risk factors associated with acute ZIKV infection?\n", "The risk factors associated with acute ZIKV infection include living in regions undergoing a current outbreak of ZIKV and exposure to mosquitoes.

As a result, warmer temperature conditions mainly during the rainy season, both contributing to high humidity levels, allow tropical mosquitos to flourish, thus, promoting the occurrence of Aedes-borne outbreaks and persistent virus circulation between host and vector populations [26, 27] .\n\n In the Pacific region, Aedes mosquitoes have been identified as the main disease vector species. Mainly causing dengue epidemics linked to a single DENV serotype throughout the past, recent research identified the co-circulation of not only different dengue virus serotypes (types one to four), but newly emerging Aedes-borne Zika and chikungunya transmission [28] . Regular DENV outbreaks had been reported since 1960s from the Pacific region. Since then, DENV has established endemic and epidemic circulation. In the early 21st century, ZIKV (since 2007) and CHIKV (since 2011) epidemics occurred for the first time [21] . The most important mosquito-borne viral genera in the Pacific region include Alphaviruses (family Togaviridae), e.g., chikungunya virus, and Flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae), e.g., Zika and dengue virus. Those viruses could primarily be linked to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is mainly present in human residential areas, and Aedes albopictus, mainly found in peri-urban or rural areas [29] . DEN, ZIKV, and CHIKV are tropical mosquito-borne viruses that share biological similarities with other viral agents such as Ross River virus (closely related to CHIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus (closely related to DENV and ZIKV). They primarily spread through the bite of disease-carrying female mosquitoes of the genus Aedes (Stegomyia), such as Aa. aegypti, Ae. africanus, Ae. hensilli, and Ae. albopictus [30] . Unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV is known to further be passed from human to human through perinatal, congenital, sexual, and transfusion transmission [31] . Blood-borne transmission and intrapartum transmission have also been reported for CHIKV [32] . The main reservoir hosts include human and non-human primates and may further be present in other wild and domestic animals. The incidence and severity of mosquito-borne arbovirus infections that can be maintained in human-vector-human-cycles (with no involvement of animals in the transmission cycle) such as DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV, has increased in the Pacific regions during the past years [28] . Especially in populations with poor herd immunity (high susceptibility due to low seroprevalence levels in the population) and lacking resilience capacities, the (re-)emergence of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) is particularly hazardous to human health, often leading to major outbreaks.\n\n As far as the identification of outbreaks is concerned, a further aim of this study, Table 2 describes the nature of some recent DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV outbreaks in different Pacific Island States, with an emphasis on the associated public health challenges and implications. Despite their epidemic potential, the clinical picture of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV is often mild, and symptoms often go unrecognized [37] . Mild presentation of all three viral infections includes flu-like symptoms, with fever, rash, and malaise, which often results in misdiagnosis when laboratory confirmation is missing [37, 38] . Most people recover fully, however, in rare cases infection may cause severe health complications such as encephalitis, neurological disorders, infantile malformations (ZIKV), severe and long-lasting arthralgia (CHIKV), or hemorrhagic manifestations (DENV), leading to hospitalization or fatal complications. Yet, the interaction between the different pathogens is poorly understood. At present, for all three mosquito-borne viral diseases there is no antiviral treatment [39] , however, there are advances for the control of these diseases, e.g., the first licensed dengue vaccine and other vaccine candidates [40] . Personal protection, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, application of insect repellents, insecticides spraying, bed nets application, as well as consequent cleaning of mosquito breeding sites remain the primarily prevention strategies.", "qa": [["0_209406803_3_1", "What are the main mosquito-borne viral genera in the Pacific region?\n", "The main mosquito-borne viral genera in the Pacific region include Alphaviruses (e.g., chikungunya virus) and Flaviviruses (e.g., Zika and dengue virus).
