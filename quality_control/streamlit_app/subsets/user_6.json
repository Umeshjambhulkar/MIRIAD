Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Interaction terms between covariates and the logarithm of time in the Cox model did not reach the recommended level of statistical significance for in-teraction (P \u03fe .01) 25 ; therefore, we considered that the proportional hazards assumption was satisfied.\n\n When we analyzed the data regarding the self-reported intention to breastfeed and reasons for not initiating breastfeeding and for stopping breastfeeding, the proportion of nonsmokers who reported that they knew that they would breastfeed (65.4%) was significantly greater than that reported by smokers who quit during pregnancy (48.40%), light smokers (48.6%), and moderate/heavy smokers (43.9%; Table 3). Breastfeeding intention before the birth of an infant was significantly correlated with actual breastfeeding ( \u03ed 0.8; P \u03fd .0001). No statistically significant differences existed between the smoking categories in the proportions of women who indicated reasons for not initiating breastfeeding or reasons for ceasing breastfeeding. For nonsmokers, light smokers, and moderate/heavy smokers, the most common reason for not breastfeeding was \"not liking breastfeeding.\" After \"other,\" the next most common reason for not breastfeeding was \"having to return to school or work\" (nonsmokers and light smokers) or \"having another child to care for\" (moderate/heavy smokers). The 2 most common reasons for stopping breastfeeding for all groups were either believing that they \"did not produce enough breast milk\" or \"breast milk alone did not satisfy infant.\" \"Difficulty nursing\" was the third most common reason to wean for nonsmokers, whereas having to return to school or work was the third most common reason given by both light and moderate/heavy smokers ( Table 3 ).\n\n The aPAF was calculated for each of the study variables in the models. The aPAF for smoking (11.9% [95% CI: 0.3%-22.1%]) was the only factor that was statistically significant.\n\n Our study provides evidence that moderate/heavy and light smoking during the postpartum period were associated with failure to initiate breastfeeding. For mothers who initiated breastfeeding, postpartum smoking was also associated with weaning sooner, compared with women who did not smoke.

We could not directly evaluate the involvement of AhR in ICA-mediated protection from GVHD because AhR 2/2 mice lack not only AhR, but also ILC3s. 44 Thus, transplants into AhR 2/2 recipients cannot distinguish potential AhR-dependent effects of ICA from those arising from the absence ILC3 cells. Secondary transplants into chimeric animals lacking AhR in either the parenchymal or hematopoietic compartment are likewise difficult to interpret, because ILC3s in chimeric animals remain of recipient origin even several months posttransplant. 43 Although ICA significantly decreased intestinal damage following both TBI and chemotherapy, which likely contributed to improved outcomes, ICA treatment also led to host-specific tolerance of donor T cells in surviving animals (Figure 4 ), suggesting that indoles may have multiple effects at various stages of disease, and in multiple cell types or tissues. Whereas the protective response of ICA in the context of g-irradiation depends on IFN1 responses, transcriptomic data indicate that ICA activates IFN1 responses, but only in the context of GVHD, suggesting the capacity of ICA to elicit a protective IFN1-dependent signaling response may Figure 6 ) that were identified as ISGs by Interferome database analysis.\n\n be linked to concomitant immune-mediated inflammation. Although IFN1 signaling is typically indicative of antiviral responses, recent evidence suggests a role for IFN1 in anti-inflammatory responses as well, particularly in the intestinal tract. [34] [35] [36] Although no viral infection is associated with GVHD, induction of ISGs by ICA may promote survival by stimulating tissue-protective responses akin to those required to survive viral infections.\n\n IFN1 signaling in part mitigates GVHD by protecting the gut from radiation-induced tissue damage initiated by myeloablative conditioning prior to transplant and, by extension, activation of allogeneic T-cell responses associated with GVHD. 37 IFN1 effects in this context depend on nonhematopoietic cells and require neither ILC3s nor IL-22. Protection from g-irradiation by ICA depends on IFN1 signaling (Figure 7 ) and is characterized by increased barrier integrity that limits bacterial translocation ( Figure 2 ) and by reduced damage and/or increased repair of the epithelia (Figure 7C-E) . Thus, indoles acting via IFN1 signaling appear to limit epithelial damage and promote barrier integrity following g-irrad2iation. The observation that mortality increased as K12 colonization and urinary indole levels declined ( Figure 1 ) and that IFN1 gene expression is elevated by ICA during this period (day 20-40) suggests that ICA signaling via IFN1 is required during this period. These data are in line with reports that IFN1 signaling primarily in the hematopoietic compartment is required to limit CD4-dependent GVHD in the colon and augment CD8-dependent GVL responses by donor CTLs. 38 Suppression of T cells in the intestinal tract by activation of IFN1 signaling does not account for all of the protective effect of indoles because decreased donor T-cell infiltration in the lungs was seen with ICA treatment. Moreover, GVL, which appears unaffected by ICA ( Figure 5 ), typically requires both CD4and CD8-dependent T-cell responses. 45 The capacity to dissociate GVHD from GVL with ICA or with colonization of the intestinal tract with tryptophanase-producing microbes may prove clinically significant. A concern with any prophylactic GVHD therapy is that the activation and proliferation of alloreactive T cells is suppressed, but not eliminated, such that withdrawal of the prophylactic drug would lead to recrudescence of T-cell activation. However, our data show that even short-term treatment with ICA, initiated at the time of transplant, promoted survival, and that recipient strain-specific tolerance of donor T cells was evident after 45 days of ICA exposure. Moreover, although the full protective effects of ICA were realized when it was administered only early posttransplant (day 22 to 12), an additional protective effect was evident when ICA was provided only after day 12 ( Figure 4B ). The reconstitution of normal levels of CD4 1 and CD8 1 donor-derived T cells after ICA treatment suggests that enteral ICA administration did not lead to global immunosuppression nor to any dysfunction of engrafted donor T cells that would pose an increased risk for opportunistic infections in those treated with ICA. Indeed, the capacity of donor-derived T cells from ICA-treated survivors to respond upon retransplantation or in MLRs suggests that ICA promotes development of recipient-specific tolerance rather than anergy. Accordingly, the preservation of the GVL effect in the presence of ICA suggests that activation of donor T cells by hemato-lymphoid antigens outside of the intestinal tract persists and results in killing of allo-antigen-expressing recipient-type leukemia cells. Previous studies have shown that low urinary 3-IS levels are correlated with severity of GVHD. 19 However, ours is the first showing that enteral administration of ICA or indole expressing microbes can provide prophylactic cytoprotective activity in GVHD while maintaining GVL responses.

In spite of the encouraging results obtained after transplantation of epithelial cells, [5] [6] [7] it is difficult to interpret these results and to distinguish between the recruitment and differentiation of host and transplanted cells. 8, 9 ventive Dental Science, University of Manitoba, 780 Bannatyne Ave, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 0W2 Canada One challenge of the data interpretation in these investigations was that the transplanted cells were not labeled and therefore it was impossible to compare their contributions to periodontal healing with those of the host cells. Previously, cell-tracking studies have demonstrated migratory behavior of lac-Z-positive cells transplanted into rat brain 10 or adult rat liver. 11 These results indicate that this labeling method could be used in the periodontium for assessing the fate and differentiation of transplanted cells. The study of PL cells in steady-state conditions has limitations because of the relatively small number of proliferating cells, an overlap in the temporal expression of phenotypic markers of PL cell populations, 3 and the existence of cells at different stages of differentiation. 12 If PL cells could be synchronously stimulated to proliferate, then the temporal expression of matrix proteins could be more accurately related to the developmental stage of nascent cell populations in repopulating wound sites. In this context, tooth movement could be used to induce cell differentiation in the PL as previously described. 13 A tooth-movement model also permits reproducible experimental manipulations and excludes bacterial infection and epithelial down-growth.\n\n Collectively, the objectives of the study were to determine the extent of differentiation of PL and ES cells compared the quiescent tissue remodeling and the capacity of these cells to promote healing of periodontal tissues undergoing orthodontic tooth movement.\n\n After the initiation of orthodontic tooth movement, labeled PL cells (lac-Z positive cells) or ES cells (green fluorescent protein [GFP]-positive cells) were transplanted using the periodontal window wound model.\n\n \n\n Transgenic male C57BL/6J B26; 129, 10-12 week old, 25-35 g carrying Escherichia coli \u2424-galactosidase lac-Z genes (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me) were used to generate labeled PL cells.\n\n 14 (GFP-labeled mouse ES cells were a gift from Dr Nagy's lab, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario).

However, the awareness of parents, especially mothers from the stages of child development and the circumstance of optimal nutrition are important and critical in promoting child's development and prevent from nutritional short stature and increase the opportunity of child to enjoy a healthy and active life in adulthood.\n\n % of children under five (800,000 children) suffer from moderate to severe short stature, 10.9 % suffer from moderate to severe underweight (540,000 children) and 4.9 % of them (170,000 children) suffer from moderate to severe cachexia (thinness). [6] The similar study in Isfahan (Isfahan, as the capital of Isfahan province, is one of central cities in Iran) showed that one in every nine children had moderate to severe underweight and one in every 3-4 children had mild underweight. Approximately 37 % of mothers are not familiar with growth monitoring chart and 70 % of them do not a correct interpretation from their child's weight curve.

Thanks to assessment, the structure and organizing the projects can be analyzed and their strength and weak points can be identified and thus it can make it easier to achieve objectives and goals.

The first major milestone for surgical treatment came in the 1960s with the introduction of the Harrington method, which was a major breakthrough [11] . As experience grew, it was later realized that this method provides correction in only one plane. Later sublaminar wiring was introduced for the treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis, which after numerous modifications is still in use today [14, 15] . However, enormous research began in search of a better correction technique in idiopathic scoliosis. The second major breakthrough came in 1984 with the introduction of the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) technique [5, 6] , which by using two rods, a combination of pedicular, laminar and transverse hooks with pedicular screws and the so-called derotation technique promised a bright future for the treatment of scoliosis. In 1990, the first author had the opportunity to get acquainted with this technique first hand. However, his early positive enthusiasm about the technique soon lead to confusion and criticism of the technique, as it was not providing the proper correction in all three planes as primarily intended, especially considering the rotation of the vertebra [9] . Worldwide, including our team began research on implant modification to better achieve correction in all planes. One of these implant modifications is the so-called bipedicular spinal fixation device (BSF) [3] and the Universal Clamp [16] . Although the BSF was biomechanically tested and clinical introduction was mentioned, we were not able to find clinical results in the literature, and studying it, we have our doubts about its ability to control vertebral tilt.\n\n The first author began in-depth research trying to find the biomechanical origin of the development of a scoliotic curve. Based on his experiment the ''Rotational preconstraint'' theory was described as one plausible cause for idiopathic curve formation [7] . The next step was to oppose a correcting force to this curve forming force. The easiest way was to apply a force tilting the vertebrae inversely. However, it was clear that if this were achieved by a simultaneous bilateral grasp as lateral as possible this would assure the smallest charge on the instrumented vertebrae. Therefore, the hooks' end was put in the two costotransversal spaces. This way the so-called CAB hooks (Sanatmetal, Eger, Hungary) were created, CAB being the acronym of the French Corhet \u00e0 Appui Bilat\u00e9ral, meaning Bilaterally Pushing Hooks [8] .\n\n The new implant is an auxiliary one to all systems working according to the CD principle that is using two parallel rods. Its use also resolved one of the main problems of the CD technique: the relatively modest derotation of the rotated thoracic vertebrae, one major contradiction of the CD principle [9] . One proof of the insufficient derotation achievable by the classical CD technique beside criticism was the introduction of the in situ bending technique [12] .\n\n Regarding the belief that the transverse process is fragile, the authors carried out thorough investigations confirming its mechanical reliability when charged close to its base, like it is in the case with the loaded CAB hooks [10] . Although there is no doubt about the mechanical effectiveness of pedicular screws, however, the need in high tech instrumentation [2, 17] and despite that the high rate of screw misplacement [1] underline the usefulness of an easy to use and effective implant as the CAB hook is.\n\n The CAB implants are simple in structure. They are made in two main forms, symmetrical and asymmetrical, in various sizes (Fig. 1) . They are ''horseshoe'' shaped, and both of their hooked ends are designed in such a way that either cranially or caudally they circle around the basis of the transverse processes and are fixed in the costotransverse space. The two rods are connected onto the CAB hook by means of two screw-fastened latches.\n\n The patients are operated through the usual posterior approach in prone position on a spine surgical table [4] . The paravertebral muscles are detached and the transverse processes are identified. Next, the spinous processes are removed and if fusion is required, the facet joints are damaged. Only a few implant-specific instruments are required for the insertion of the hook (Fig. 2) . First by using the special CAB rasp (Fig. 2a) . The place of the CAB hooks is made in the costotransversal space. The use of an image intensifier is not necessary for the proper placement of the hooks. With the aid of the CAB template which is available in, symmetric, left, and right forms, the proper size of the CAB hook required is determined (Fig. 2b) .", "qa": [["65_19234404_0_1", "What were the major breakthroughs in the surgical treatment of scoliosis and how did they contribute to advancements in correction techniques?", "The major breakthroughs in the surgical treatment of scoliosis were the introduction of the Harrington method in the 1960s and the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) technique in 1984.

Therefore, if possible, the models used in the BIA should predict the probability of redeploying any labor or capital savings to other areas of care and predict how the savings will be realized in time. Decision-makers must accept that assumptions will inevitably be involved in predicting the probability of redeploying resources and should be willing to discuss the validity of these assumptions.\n\n Depending on the nature of the new intervention, it might be important to describe the preconditions of its effective introduction, for example, the need for training of medical staff, development of new clinical guidelines, diagnostic facilities, etc. Financial requirements for these preconditions should be summarized.\n\n on final results should be tested using sensitivity analysis. Two major sources of uncertainty are distinguished: parameter uncertainty, uncertainty about the true numerical values of the parameters used as inputs, and model uncertainty, model structure uncertainty, and modeling process uncertainty. At a minimum, the analyst should conduct one-way sensitivity analyses to determine where uncertainty or lack of agreement about some key parameter's value or the functional form of the model could have a substantial impact on conclusion. Furthermore the analyst should conduct multiway sensitivity analyses for important parameters. Where parameter uncertainty is a major concern, a plausible range should be estimated, for example, extreme values of each key variable in the analysis, clinically meaningful range, and 95% confidence interval. Alternatively the analyst varies the parameter over a range to determine at what values of the parameter major changes in conclusion are warranted. When there is substantial uncertainty other than parameter uncertainty, the analyst may need to use simulation in a substantially more sophisticated way.\n\n As previously mentioned, because there is likely to be significant uncertainty around the inputs, for example, diffusion rate and probability of redeploying resources, it would be wise to allow for them to be varied in any interactive model.\n\n Data on a pharmaceutical agent and its use .

There were significant but modest correlations between baseline lesion measures and subsequent ventricular enlargement. Conclusions: (1) Lesions and atrophy are both associated with early relapse leading to a diagnosis of clinical MS; (2) while lesions contribute to the development of atrophy, atrophy may also develop by other mechanisms. This suggests that MR measures have a complementary role in monitoring the course of MS, even from the earliest clinical stage. P revious radiological and pathological studies have established that whole brain [1] [2] [3] and spinal cord atrophy 4 5 occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) in excess of that expected with age. In one study, progressive cerebral atrophy over one year has been detected using registered, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure both brain and ventricular volumes, 6 with a rate of cerebral atrophy in MS shown to be twice that seen in normal controls and the rate of ventricular enlargement five times that of controls. There was also a good correspondence between global brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement. 6 While the mechanisms of atrophy in MS are not well understood, it probably indicates loss of functionally important structures: myelin and axons that are the majority bulk of brain white matter, although variable effects on tissue volumes may also arise from glial cell proliferation or loss, gliosis, inflammation, and oedema. 7 A correlation between reduced cerebral white matter N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) (a neuronal marker) and cerebral atrophy suggest that axonal loss may make a contribution. 8 However, the relation between atrophy and decreased NAA is non-linear, 9 and factors other than axonal loss are also likely to effect these MR measures. In general, disability in MS has been more strongly correlated with measures of atrophy than lesion load. 10 11 However, only modest correlations between atrophy and lesion load have been observed. 12 13 This could indicate that atrophy develops by mechanisms, some of which are independent of lesions, or that there is a temporal dissociation between lesion accumulation that occurs early in the disease process and atrophy, which occurs late.\n\n To investigate the onset of atrophy and its relation to lesions and clinical events, we studied patients presenting with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of MS. The study of this cohort permits an investigation into the earliest clinical stages of MS, as long term follow up indicates that the majority of CIS patients with MRI brain lesions will go on to develop clinically definite MS. [14] [15] [16] [17] In this report, atrophy was evaluated using a measure of ventricular enlargement. This study follows a previous preliminary pilot study of a small, selected group of 17 from within the present larger cohort of 55 patients. 18 The purposes of the study were:\n\n 1 To confirm the preliminary study showing that measurable ventricular enlargement develops over one year in some patients with patients with CIS.\n\n 2 To clarify whether ventricular enlargement is associated with the early development of MS, using conventional clinical criteria and the new McDonald criteria.\n\n 3 To determine the relation between ventricular enlargement and MR measurements of lesion load at this early stage of disease.\n\n \n\n We recruited adult patients, aged between 17 and 50 years, who presented to our clinics at Moorfields Eye Hospital or the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery with CIS suggestive of MS. Appropriate investigations including full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), autoantibody screen, syphilis serology, vitamin B12, and brain MRI were used to exclude other diagnoses. Fifty five patients were recruited consecutively from January 1996 until June 1999 (16 patients, recruited before a hardware upgrade to the scanner in January 1996 were excluded from this study because serial evaluations before and after upgrade revealed instability of volume measures. Ongoing quality assurance protocols have confirmed the stability of measurements since January 1996). A CIS was defined as a single event of acute onset in the central nervous system suggestive of demyelination, for example, unilateral optic neuritis, brain stem and partial spinal cord syndromes. Patients with a history of previous neurological symptoms suggestive of demyelination were excluded. Other diagnoses were excluded by appropriate investigations. Overall, 38 patients had optic neuritis, 11 a brain stem syndrome, five a spinal cord syndrome (spinal MRI excluded an alternative structural cause in these cases), and one patient had a hemianopia attributable to an MRI lesion in the optic tract.\n\n The age range at baseline was 17 to 50 years with a median age of 31 years. The upper age limit of 50 years was applied to reduce the likelihood of including patients with white matter lesions attributable to small vessel disease and because onset of MS above this age is less common.", "qa": [["75_40371274_0_1", "What are the potential mechanisms of atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS)?\n", "The mechanisms of atrophy in MS are not well understood, but they may involve the loss of myelin and axons, glial cell proliferation or loss, gliosis, inflammation, and edema.

However, the incidence of ectopic adrenal tissue in the liver is exceedingly rare. Embryologically, the adrenal cells have different embryological origin: the cortex is derived from the mesoderm and the medulla from the ectoderm of the neural crest. The fatal cortex is formed during the fourth and fifth weeks from the mesoderm, which lines the posterior abdominal wall. Cells from the neural crest invade the primitive cortex to form the medulla. Encapsulation of the medulla occurs late in fetal development [1, 12, 13] . It is postulated that adrenal rests within the genital structures were due to mechanical separation and displacement of portions of cortical tissue and associate with gonadal tissue during its descent. Bozic suggested that the unusual location of ectopic tissue may be related to misplaced mesothelial cells or autonomous differentiation of mesodermal elements [14] .\n\n The clinical significance of ectopic adrenal tissue is usually minimal and typically not associated with endocrine abnormalities. Only two cases were described as functional hepatic adrenal rest tumors, which can cause problems, including hyperplasia and neoplasia [3, 4, 15] .\n\n An accurate preoperative radiological diagnosis is very difficult. An adrenal rest tumor usually appears as a round, well-defined mass in the right hepatic lobe. One specific radiological diagnostic character is the presence of fat components [6] . This will reflect intracytoplasmic lipid droplets of the tumor cells. The other diagnostic character is hypervascularity. The hepatic adrenal rest tumor is mainly supplied by the hepatic artery [7] . At dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, angiomyolipoma also demonstrates early intense contrast enhancement [16] . MRI typically demonstrates the fat component and prominent central vessels. In this case, it is important to differentiate between adrenal rest tumor and early HCC. The typical MRI appearance of early HCC is iso-to hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images [17] . Early HCC shows hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase in Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI [18] . In our case, the remarkable radiological findings were hypervascularity in the arterial phase and washout in the delay phase, which was similar to HCC. However, T2-weighted imaging showed high intensity at the tumor. As MRI findings were not typical, we should try biopsy.\n\n Macroscopically, a hepatic adrenal rest tumor is a wellcircumscribed, yellowish, nodular lesion, which usually occurs under the capsule of the right hepatic lobe [19] . The pathologic appearance of this tissue is characteristic. The findings consist of cord-like arrangements of round to polygonal, pale, lipid-rich cells separated by vascular channels or bands of collagen [5] . However, Sugiyama reported that it is difficult to distinguish between hepatic adrenal rest tumor and HCC on the basis of histologic analysis alone [11] . Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor cells to be weakly stained for Hep-per-1, which can be considered a specific marker for HCC. Synaptophysin, inhibin, and CD56 are thought to be sensitive markers for adrenal cortical cells. In particular, CD56 is an excellent marker for distinguishing adrenal cortical cells from hepatocytes [20] . In this case, due to the influence of operative hemorrhage, we could not identify the tumor macroscopically. Nevertheless, microscopic findings showed the characteristic features of cortical adrenal tissue. Immunohistochemistry shows that the tumor in our case was negative for HCC markers and positive for adrenal cortical cell markers. Therefore, we considered this tumor to be an adrenal rest tumor.\n\n We described a rare case of adrenal rest tumor of the liver. Adrenal rest tumors are rare and uncommonly found in the liver. This tumor was similar to HCC in the radiological findings. A reliable diagnosis is difficult by radiological findings alone.

Both these processes may promote gastric cytoprotection and contribute to ulcer healing, and thus rats administered oral and parenteral TFF2 are relatively resistant to gastric erosions induced by indomethacin or alcohol (27, 28) . These functions may involve the presence of specific receptors for TFF2. However, while several candidate binding proteins have been characterized (29, 30) , no conclusive TFF2 receptor has been found.\n\n To study further the functional importance of TFF2, we have generated mice deficient in TFF2 through targeted gene disruption.

Three rounds of screening resulted in four individual positive clones that were plaque purified and amplified.

Restriction endonuclease mapping was performed. Sequencing of both strands was by the dideoxynucleotide method (2, 3, 33) . The subcloned insert contained four coding exons, 3.5 kb of 5\u2032 flanking sequence, and 8 kb of 3\u2032 flanking sequence. The identity of this clone was confirmed by the presence of the TFF2 cDNA sequence identified previously and by similar restriction patterns of mouse genomic and plasmid DNA.\n\n Mapping of exon-intron borders. Exon-intron borders were assessed by sequencing and confirmed by amplification of introns by PCR using primers derived from intronic and intron-exon spanning sequences.

This gap is particularly marked in breast cancer survivors: in a registry-based study from Norway, the hazard ratio (HR) for pregnancy in female breast cancer survivors, compared with healthy controls, was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.27-0.39). By contrast, the pregnancy HR for all female cancer survivors compared with healthy controls was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58-0.64), and the chance of pregnancy in a female survivor of thyroid cancer or melanoma was equivalent to that in healthy controls. 5 Therefore, now more than ever, breast cancer clinicians must assess and address fertility-related concerns as part of routine care in young women with breast cancer.\n\n However, fertility risks and preservation options are presently underdiscussed by the medical oncology community. 6 In one study of women diagnosed with localized breast cancer at 40 years of age or younger, only 68% reported having discussed fertility issues with their clinical team before starting therapy, 7 and in a physician survey in the United States, fewer than half of oncology providers always or often referred patients with fertility-related questions to a fertility specialist. 8 Even when issues are addressed, there is a dearth of information to inform fertility concerns and decision-making. Although the fertility implications of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment carry significant weight for most young women with breast cancer, 7 studies of fertility outcomes are currently limited, decision-making around pregnancy and fertility preservation remains highly individualized, and large studies in this area have been difficult to accomplish, even as the relevant population expands. Nonetheless, recent data and ongoing research continue to improve our understanding of the fertility-related risks and the pros and cons of interventions to preserve fertility for young breast cancer survivors.\n\n The risk of infertility related to breast cancer treatment is a difficult topic to study for a variety of reasons. First, few studies have focused on and collected pertinent outcomes, such as return of menses, successful pregnancy, and timing of permanent menopause after systemic therapy. 9 Second, it is difficult to determine the right metric for fertility. Although it is easiest to assess for the presence or absence of menses, data in the postchemotherapy population demonstrate that ovarian reserve may be diminished despite the resumption of regular menses. 10, 11 For feasibility purposes, menses are equated with fertility in much of the breast cancer fertility literature, necessitating the use of this equivalence throughout this review; however, it should be noted that menstruation does not necessarily connote fertility.\n\n Lastly, there appears to be substantial heterogeneity in outcomes between patients, and only limited research has identified important patient-specific determinants beyond age. In one retrospective study of premenopausal patients with breast cancer, the odds ratio of developing chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA) was 10.1 and 39.5 in patients aged 35 to 39 years and 40 to 44 years, respectively, compared with a reference group of patients younger than 35 years old. 12 Given that the risk of CRA increases by an order of magnitude over just a 5-to 10-year interval, considering average CRA rates for all premenopausal women is of limited value for an individual patient; age-stratified data and discovery of biomarkers predictive of fertility after treatment are needed and are the focus of ongoing research efforts.\n\n Despite these limitations, a general understanding and estimation of a woman's infertility risk with a specific treatment regimen are necessary components of effective fertility preservation counseling. Table 1 summarizes data on rates of persistent CRA after different chemotherapy regimens, with a focus on modern regimens and on analyses that separate patients by age group. CRA rates in patients older than 50 years are not included in the table, because rates approach 100% regardless of chemotherapy regimen as women approach the age of natural menopause. 12 A few general principles for predicting ovarian toxicity of breast cancer chemotherapy should be underscored. The risk of CRA directly correlates with cyclophosphamide dose, because alkylating agents are particularly gonadotoxic.", "qa": [["30_26450327_0_1", "What are the fertility preservation options available for young women diagnosed with breast cancer?", "Fertility preservation options for young women diagnosed with breast cancer include embryo cryopreservation, oocyte cryopreservation, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.

Current thinking is that the major remaining possibilities are a hypersensitivity syndrome or a functional syndrome, the distinction being that in the case of a hypersensitivity syndrome symptoms are attributable to reflux events, whereas in the case of a functional syndrome they are not. This is a subtle distinction and a domain in which there is currently no high-quality evidence supporting one management approach or another.\n\n Grade A: strongly recommended based on good evidence that it improves important health outcomes I. Twice-daily PPI therapy as an empirical trial for patients with suspected reflux chest pain syndrome after a cardiac etiology has been carefully considered.\n\n Chest pain indistinguishable from ischemic cardiac pain can be caused by GERD. Because the morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic heart disease is substantially greater than that of GERD and because of the impressive array of available therapeutic interventions, this diagnosis must be thoroughly considered before accepting a diagnosis of reflux chest pain syndrome. Once ischemic heart disease has been adequately considered, the relative rarity of esophageal motor disorders in this group of patients, as well as results from empirical treatment trials of acid suppressive therapy, suggest that GERD may be the next most likely etiology. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled treatment trials in patients with suspected reflux chest pain suggest benefit from a 4-week trial with twice-daily PPI therapy. If a patient continues to have chest pain despite this course of therapy, diagnostic testing with esophageal manometry and pH or impedance-pH monitoring can exclude motility disorders or refractory reflux symptoms. Grade B: recommended with fair evidence that it improves important outcomes I. Acute or maintenance therapy with once-or twice-daily PPIs (or H 2 RAs) for patients with a suspected extraesophageal GERD syndrome (laryngitis, asthma) with a concomitant esophageal GERD syndrome.\n\n \n\n I. Once-or twice-daily PPIs (or H 2 RAs) for acute treatment of patients with potential extraesophageal GERD syndromes (laryngitis, asthma) in the absence of a concomitant esophageal GERD syndrome.\n\n Grade Insuff: no recommendation, insufficient evidence to recommend for or against I. Once-or twice-daily PPIs for patients with suspected reflux cough syndrome.\n\n Chronic cough, laryngitis, and asthma have an established association with GERD on the basis of population-based studies. However, cough, laryngitis, and asthma have a multitude of potential etiologies other than GERD, making them nonspecific for GERD. Furthermore, the causal relationship of GERD with these nonspecific syndromes in the absence of a concomitant esophageal GERD syndrome remains controversial and unproven. The only randomized controlled trials showing a treatment effect for GERD therapies in these syndromes were in patients with esophageal GERD syndromes in addition to either laryngitis or asthma. Hence, existing evidence supports the following: (1) the association between these syndromes and GERD, (2) the rarity of extraesophageal GERD syndromes without concomitant esophageal symptoms or findings, (3) that suspected extraesophageal GERD syndromes are usually multifactorial, and (4) that data substantiating benefit from the treatment of reflux for the extraesophageal syndromes are very weak. Furthermore, clinical predictors implicating GERD in the extraesophageal syndromes have proven elusive, and the premature adoption of flawed diagnostic criteria has likely resulted in the overdiagnosis of extraesophageal GERD syndromes.\n\n Given the nonspecific nature of the extraesophageal symptoms and the poor sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests such as pH monitoring, laryngoscopy, or endoscopy for establishing an etiology of GERD, empirical therapy with PPIs has become common practice. Most therapeutic trials of these syndromes have used twice-daily dosing of PPIs for treatment periods of 3-4 months. The rationale for this unapproved dosing for unapproved indications comes from pH monitoring data showing that the likelihood of normalizing esophageal acid exposure with twice-daily PPIs in patients with GERD is 93%-99%, the logic then being that lesser dosing does not exclude the possibility of a poor response because of inadequate acid suppression.

Primary pediatric care providers are more likely to have earlier contact with children. Therefore, pediatricians as well as primary care health professionals will be responsible for the prevention of ECC. The diagnosis of impaired dentition and related prevention and outcomes should be included in their curricula. Primary prevention of ECC begins in the prenatal and perinatal periods (include pregnancy and first month of birth) and addresses the health of both mother and infant. Mother's or caregiver's teeth must be examined infants whose mothers have high levels of untreated dental caries are at greater risk of acquiring organisms. General approach which have been used to prevent ECC include training of mothers or caregivers to follow healthy dietary and feeding habits to prevent the development of ECC, early screening for signs of caries development (starting from about 7 to 8 month of age) to identify infants who are at risk developing ECC and assisting in providing information for parents about promoting oral health. Pediatricians can give the following recommendations for prevention of ECC to mothers and caregivers (AAPD, 2003b):\n\n \u2022 Elimination of active dental caries lesions, gingival disease,\n\n \u2022 Using fluoride and clorhexidine (Toothpaste, mouthwash, gel, varnish),\n\n \u2022 Twice daily tooth brushing of the dentate infant (around 7 th month of age),\n\n \u2022 Oral health evaluation of the infant by a pediatric dentist before the first birthday,\n\n \u2022 Infants should not be put to sleep with a bottle and nocturnal breastfeeding should be avoided after the first primary tooth begins to erupt,\n\n \u2022 Mothers should be encouraged to have infants drink from a cup as they approach their first birthday,\n\n \u2022 Infants should be weaned from the bottle at 12 to 14 months of age,\n\n \u2022 An attempt should be made to assess and decrease the mother's/primary caregiver's mutans streptococci level to decrease the transmission of cariogenic bacteria,\n\n \u2022 Stop saliva-sharing activities, such as tasting food before feeding and sharing toothbrushes. \n\n MS, consisting mainly of the species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, are commonly cultured from the mouths of infants, with prevalence of infection ranging from around 30 % in 3 month old predentate children to over 80 % in 24 month old children with primary teeth. MS is usually transmitted to children through their mothers. Domejean et al. (2010) indicated that MS can colonize horizontal as well as vertical transmission does occur.\n\n Complementary Pediatrics\n\n The risk of transmission increases with high maternal salivary levels of MS and frequent inoculation. K\u00f6hler & Andreen (2010) reported that children colonised by MS at an early stage developed more caries than those colonised at a later stage and early maternal caries prevention is an efficient method to prevent early colonization of MS in their children.\n\n Factors that affect the colonization of MS may be divided into bacterial virulence, hostrelated and environmental factors. Complex interactions among these factors determine the success and timing of MS colonization in the child. As clinical studies have shown that caries risk is correlated with age at which initial MS colonization occurred, strategies for the prevention of dental caries should include timely control of colonization of the cariogenic bacteria in the mouths of young children.\n\n Dentistry, particularly dentistry for children has come a long way toward reaching a ratio of 90% prevention to 10% treatment in many developed countries. At the core of this preventive approach is home oral hygiene and plaque control. The traditional focus of oral hygiene has been and will go on to be the control of the two most prevalent oral diseases, caries and periodontal disease. Although plaque control is essential for oral hygiene, it is important to realize that no clear relationship exists between plaque control and the prevention of caries (unlike with periodontal disease). As discussed previously in the section 2.1, the complex etiology of caries centers on the following factors: tooth susceptibility, bacterial plaque, refined carbohydrates, and time. Many other variables such as oral sugar clearance and salivary flow and pH, add to the complexity of the caries process. This complex etiology helps to explain the difficulty in demonstrating a relationship between oral hygiene practices and caries prevention. Despite this ambiguity, plaque control remains an essential element for oral health. In the absence of oral hygiene dental plaque accumulates leading to shifts in bacterial populations away from those associated with health.", "qa": [["69_41777294_8_1", "What strategies can pediatricians and primary care health professionals implement to prevent Early Childhood Caries (ECC), and how are these strategies influenced by the transmission of cariogenic bacteria from mothers to their children?", "Pediatricians and primary care health professionals can play a vital role in preventing Early Childhood Caries (ECC).

These strategies are influenced by the transmission of cariogenic bacteria, such as mutans streptococci (MS), from mothers to their children.
