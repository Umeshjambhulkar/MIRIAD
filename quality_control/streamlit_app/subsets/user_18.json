Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer reported 12.7 million new cancer cases with 7.6 million deaths in 2008 alone, 10 and this number increased in 2012. 11 The low success rate of chemotherapeutic agents has led to increased interest in the development of new anticancer compounds. One of the discovery strategies for new anticancer drugs is to explore natural compounds, including xanthones, that possess anticancer activities. Some naturally occurring xanthones have been reported to have anticancer activities. [12] [13] [14] However, natural compounds have the disadvantage of low yields obtained from the extraction processes. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a synthetic compound with higher yield to ensure the availability and continuity of production of the compound.\n\n Along with the advancements in knowledge and technology, drug discovery and development also involve computational processes, 15 including quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) analysis and molecular docking. A QSAR model generates new compounds with better predicted biological activity, 16 which can then be developed as drug candidates. Molecular docking is based on a structurebased approach and computational method using mathematical algorithms (the scoring function) to evaluate the binding tightness between the docked compound and target protein (receptor). Both QSAR analysis and molecular docking can be used individually or in combination. 17 Recently, QSAR analysis and molecular docking are among the important strategies to design new molecules and identify hit molecules in medicinal chemistry. A previous study identified some polyhydroxyxanthone derivatives (1,6-dihydroxy-, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-, and 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxyxanthones) as potent in vitro anticancer agents. The cytotoxic activity did not increase linearly with an increasing number of hydroxyl groups, which suggested that the position of the substituted group influenced the activity. 18 In addition, ten novel hydroxyl-and halogen-substituted xanthone derivatives identified by a QSAR study were synthesized. 19 Some of these compounds have been published earlier and described as having anticancer 18 and antimalarial effects. 20 These compounds have not been evaluated for efficacy against colorectal cancer.\n\n The aim of this study was to evaluate these novel xanthones and determine the most prominent descriptor for cytotoxic activity to aid the development of more active anticancer agents.

The high morbidity and mortality rate in patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza imposed significant burden even on well developed countries and advanced ICU settings. Many previous reports (19-21) emphasized the potential problem of ICU's unpreparedness for the upcoming pandemic. Physicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, as well as in the majority of countries in Eastern Europe, lack official ICU training (13) and use annual meetings and conferences as sources of information. This all affects the quality and availability of the ICU resources, especially in cases when there is a need for advanced rescue therapies. The contemporary ICUs are available in a small number of centers throughout the region, with restricted number of beds, and when faced with increased demands, the consequences can be devastating. In Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, the 2009 winter outbreak had occurred before massive vaccination was introduced and appropriate antiviral therapy in severely ill patients during the epidemic was generally delayed.\n\n It is noteworthy that all 3 ICUs have been set up recently, one of them had opened 3 months before the breakout of the pandemic, with poorly trained staff and inappropriate equipment (infusion pumps were not available in one ICU during the whole study period and renal replacement therapy was inconstantly possible to perform). In spite of all this, half of the patients survived.\n\n Intensive care medicine is frequently considered to have lower priority in low and middle income countries (22) (23) (24) . Although costs of intensive care are high, population based studies have proven it \"very cost effective\" according to WHO definition (25-27).\n\n The limitations of our study are related to a relatively small number of patients. The study included patients from three tertiary care centers who required mechanical ventilation and ICU admission and underwent routine testing for H1N1 infection the flu season. This may not necessarily be representative of all regional centers, and the total burden of pandemic in the region is likely to be higher. The study was performed on the patients with the most severe form of disease, requiring intensive care and is not representative of less severe cases who did not require admission to the ICU. Finally, high frequency oscillation was available only in one center and some rescue therapies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and inhaled nitric oxide were not accessible at all.\n\n The novel 2009 H1N1 influenza in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia showed similar characteristics to those reported in other studies from around the world, affecting predominantly young healthy individuals and those with no comorbidities. Patients presented with severe ARDS, had a great need for rescue therapies, and a high mortality. In an area with low access to intensive care and physicians' lack of training in intensive care medicine, these three newly established ICUs achieved a survival rate similar to that in other transitional countries, and slightly lower than in developed countries.\n\n Acknowledgment The authors thank nurses and physicians working in our ICUs for their energy and motivation.

Some of the novel rare variants may inform on novel causal mechanisms not captured by common variants, or converge on genes and pathways already informed by common variants thus serving to enhance the causal inference at a more functional level.\n\n In contrast to rare coding mutations whose target genes and downstream mechanisms can be more readily uncovered through traditional functional studies, identifying the causal genes that are responsible for the observed link between GWAS risk variants and CAD is not an easy task. It is estimated that two thirds of the predicted target genes of GWAS locus are not the closest by proximity (45, 46) , thus traditional proximity- based locus mapping could introduce false interpretations that bias drug target selection. This challenge can be substantially alleviated by functional genomics tools that explore potential mechanisms linking causal variants to biological phenotypes (Figure 2A) (44) . Supported by next-generation sequencing, typical functional molecular traits that may be characterized include expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), non-coding RNA, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic modification and chromatin interaction (26) . The advance of gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas has also significantly improved the efficiency of validation experiments (47) . Recent functional genomics studies have substantially refined the candidate causal genes for CAD loci such as SORT1 (48) , TRIB1 (49), ADAMTS7 (15, 50) , and TCF21 (51, 52) . Noteworthy, there have also been integrative functional genomics studies that combined genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics profiling to prioritize causal variants and affected genes (7, 46, 53 (54) . These studies greatly contribute to the accumulation of viable treatment targets for follow-up drug development efforts.\n\n Encouragingly, functional studies following GWAS are being further catalyzed by large-scale community efforts in establishing multi-cell or multi-tissue mapping of regulatory annotations. The advent of publicly available depositories such as GTEx (55), ENCODE (56) and Epigenome Roadmap (57) is gradually removing the hurdle to acquire multi-dimensional data resources necessary for the investigation of complex traits like CAD.\n\n Previous successes in drug development for CAD have testified to the effectiveness of modulating intermediate causal risk factors such as circulating cholesterol levels and blood pressure in lowering CAD risk. Therefore, knowing the causal relationship between an intermediate phenotype that correlates with CAD status is of monumental importance as it can help prioritize biomarkers as intervention targets for CAD therapeutics (58, 59) (Figure 2A) . The investigation of causal intermediate traits for CAD can be facilitated by MR, which utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables to assess the causal relationship between exposure (e.g., LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, weight-hip ratio) and outcome (CAD occurrence) (60) . We are seeing both successful and ongoing efforts in developing drugs modulating LDL cholesterol, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and lipoprotein (a) (3), whose causal relationships with CAD have been robustly verified in MR studies (61) (62) (63) . On the contrary, MR studies revealed inconsistent relationship between HDL cholesterol and CAD (64) (65) (66) . In concordance with this lack of robust support for the causality of HDL in CAD, substantial obstacles have been met during the development of inhibitors for CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein), a gene harboring several loci associated with HDL cholesterol level (67) . Three commercial CETP inhibitors, Dalcetrapib, Obicetrapib and Anacetrapib, all failed to achieve clinical efficacy during phase III clinical trials and were discontinued (68) .\n\n In addition to the well explored causal pathways such as cholesterol and blood pressure regulation, MR studies have informed several additional causal intermediate phenotypes, such as inflammation (69), uric acid (70) , and iron status (71) , that could serve as targets for future CAD drug development. By utilizing both summary-level GWAS statistics and UK Biobank data, a recent MR study demonstrated the causal association of waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index with coronary heart disease, thus providing new opportunities of intervening CAD risk by reducing abdominal obesity (72) .\n\n Drug repurposing approaches could leverage known drugs used for other diseases that target the newly uncovered CAD causal genes and pathways to counteract CAD.

Even though the most common localization is the skin, 5% of all melanomas appear in other sites of the body, including the ocular ball and, in fact, all mucosal surfaces. A very small percentage of melanomas can be diagnosed in parenchymatous organs, such as the lung, or in the retroperitoneal area. 1 The first mucosal melanoma was cited in 1859 by Weber and was later recognized as a distinct entity in 1869 by Lucke. Lincoln, in 1885, recorded the first mucosal melanoma in the English literature. Because of its rarity, this entity is poorly recognized, described, and understood. [2] [3] [4] Cutaneous and noncutaneous melanomas share the same origin cells but have divergent etiology, behavior, and molecular biology. Nowadays, genetic studies have demonstrated that melanomas are not a disease but are a family of diseases, with mucosal melanomas playing a distinct, important, and specific role. 5 The aim of the study\n\n The purpose of the study was to investigate the epidemiologic and morphologic data of mucosal melanomas diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital (Timisoara, Romania) during a period of 12 years.\n\n \n\n \n\n We retrospectively analyzed 186,111 patient files recorded in our pathology service during a period of 10 years, from January 2002 to December 2011, identifying 15 cases of mucosal melanomas. The slides were searched from the archive and reread by two individual pathologists. While preparing the study design, we also reviewed 35,815 histological slides read between January 2012 and June 2013 and selected two cases of possible mucosal melanomas.\n\n The final group included 17 cases of mucosal melanoma admitted in different departments of Timisoara's Emergency City Hospital from 2002 to 2013. After inspection of the recorded files, the pathologists noted the localization of the tumor, symptoms if available, and gross anatomy features. At the time of diagnosis, all cases were thoroughly searched to determine the cutaneous origin of the melanoma. For diagnostic purposes, all the biopsied tissue specimens were initially processed with routine histological technique, with the archive slides being stained with hematoxylin and eosin. While reading the slides, the pathologists paid attention to the histological type of the cells, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic count, and quantity of melanin pigment. \n\n In the period studied, we identified 16 primary mucosal melanomas and one secondary pleural melanoma of unknown origin. All the data regarding clinical, epidemiological, and histopathological aspects of the cases are summarized in Table 1 . Eleven of our patients were smokers.\n\n For the primary mucosal melanomas, the male/female ratio was 10:6. At the time of diagnosis, the age for men ranged between 53 and 94 years (median, 73.5 years), and for women, age ranged between 53 and 73 years (median, 63 years). Regarding localization, nine of 16 melanomas were from the head and neck region, six were diagnosed in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (three cases each), and one case had a rare localization (retroperitoneum). From these cases, one case from the urogenital melanoma group presented with a pelvic tumor that included ovary and uterus, making it impossible to determine the organ of origin.\n\n Between head and neck melanomas, we diagnosed one case of laryngeal mucosa melanoma, with the other cases being divided equally between the nasal cavity and oral mucosa (four cases each), with a clear predominance of male patients (seven of nine patients). The most frequent symptoms encountered were tumor presence and bleeding because of ulceration. The dominating cell type was epithelioid (seven cases); in only two cases of head and neck mucosal melanomas did we observe both types of cells (epithelioid and spindle). In this group, we diagnosed six cases of achromic melanomas; the other three were pigmented, with areas composed of heavily pigmented cells admixed with achromic zones. The epithelioid cells were intensely pleomorphic, whereas the spindle cells had a monomorphic appearance. The mitotic index was high (18 mitoses/10 high power fields) for the epithelioid cells tumors, with many atypical mitotic figures. At diagnosis, seven cases had localized tumor without any evidence of lymph node metastases, one showed regional lymph node metastases, and another showed concomitant systemic metastases.\n\n From this group, we decided to present four cases we considered more challenging.", "qa": [["57_6497119_0_1", "What are the different sites in the body where melanomas can originate, and how does the rarity of mucosal melanomas impact our understanding of this condition?", "Melanomas can arise in various locations in the body, including the skin, ocular ball, and mucosal surfaces.

Studies showed similar results; when pralatrexate was administered following gemcitabine, the response was additive. Following from these results, currently a phase I study involving pralatrexate and gemcitabine is underway.\n\n \n\n The novel antifolate pralatrexate has evolved as the first drug to be FDA approved specifically for the treatment of advanced PTCL. Rare and biologically diverse, PTCL is an aggressive disease with disparate responses to standard chemotherapeutic regimens, and subsequently has a poor prognosis. In the past, therapeutic guidelines for PTCL treatment have been largely influenced by those of B-cell lymphomas. Development of optimal therapies for PTCL is challenging due to its rarity and heterogeneity. Nevertheless, pralatrexate was synthesized in the early 1990s based on the structure of the conventional antifolate methotrexate. The rational design of pralatrexate, which has a high intrinsic affinity for RFC, results in greater internalization of the drug, predominantly in malignant cells. Further, the increased ability of pralatrexate to be polyglutamylated and retained with the cell correlates with increased tumor cell-death and improved anticancer activity. Pralatrexate is therefore a promising new drug for PTCL. Current and future studies will be aimed towards investigating additional treatment combinations with pralatrexate, in an attempt to acquire higher efficacy levels. It will be interesting to see whether there will additive or synergistic effects with other cancer therapies, as is widely anticipated.\n\n TCK was the recipient of AINSE awards.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Persistent low resting arterial blood pressure is prevalent after cervical SCI and, to a lesser extent, after upper thoracic SCI. 8 However, individuals with both types of injury will often experience further reductions in arterial blood pressure in the upright posture (orthostatic hypotension). [9] [10] [11] [12] Futhermore, clinical observations suggest that SCI has been associated with an increased risk of mortality from cardivascular diseases including both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease. 13 Decreased mobility, lack of exercise and unstable cardiovascular control in individuals with SCI are major contributors to the risk of development of cardiovascular diseases in this population. Unfortunately, when exercise programs are implemented in these individuals, the unstable cardiovascular control could also be a factor that prevents them from participation. Further, the presence of orthostatic hypotension significantly hampers and prolongs the rehabilitation period, increases length of hospitalization, and in many cases results in significant financial burden for the individuals and society. 14 Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem in individuals with quadriplegia and paraplegia, particularly in the acute phase. 10 Orthostatic hypotension does improve over time, although the reasons for this improvement have not been clearly established; potential mechanisms include vascular wall receptor hypersensitivity, increased skeletal muscle tone, some recovery of postural reflexes at a spinal level, adaptation of the reninangiotensin system, or other unknown mechanisms. 15 Locomotor Training (LT) using body weight support and a treadmill that practices standing and stepping has evolved from animal and human studies that indicate spinal interneuronal networks are highly dependent on continuous afferent feedback specific to these motor tasks. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Standing is considered beneficial for people with SCI who are confined to a wheelchair, as immobilization can contribute to secondary pathologies such as osteoporosis, leg muscle contractures, pressure sores, and muscle atrophy. 29, 30 However, little is known of the effect of body weight support training or standing on cardiovascular control in individuals with motor complete SCI. The ultimate goal is to evaluate whether stand LT training results in neuromuscular activation as well as activation of spinal autonomic circuits resulting in amelioration of abnormal cardiovascular control and specifically orthostatic hypotension in individuals with complete SCI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of harness application and changes in posture on cardiovascular parameters of SCI and able-bodied individuals.\n\n \n\n The UCLA Institutional Review Board approved the experimental protocol for the present study and each subject signed an informed consent form before participating in the study. Nine able-bodied individuals and 12 individuals with SCI volunteered for this study (Table 1 ). A clinician assessed the level and extent of SCI according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA/IMSoP) impairment scale. 31 All research participants were classified as having a clinically complete SCI, as they were graded as ASIA A (no motor or sensory function below the lesion including the sacral segments S 4 -S 5 ). These individuals had a stable medical condition without underlying cardiopulmonary disorders. Able-bodied individuals were healthy with no history of cardiopulmonary disease. None of the research participants were taking any antispasticity or vasoactive medications during the study and were free from caffeine on the day of evaluation.\n\n In all research participants (n \u00bc 20), we measured arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) during different postural positions both with and without the application of a harness (Figure 1 ). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained during each event at 1-min intervals for 5 min for each event. The sequence of events were as follows: (1) sitting without a harness in their wheelchair (S); (2) lying supine on a mat table Figure 1 Harness application. Harness was placed on individuals in a supine position with straps located at the lower chest and upper abdomen (a). The pelvic band and legs straps were fastened to avoid slippage (b). The specialized harness was designed by Robertson s (Las Vegas, NV, USA) and was used in previous studies of locomotor training interventions. 16, 17 The modified climbing harness was designed to distribute the forces throughout the chest and pelvic bands and reduce the force through the straps.

This new technique greatly simplified the movements of the classic surgeon, and some saw that the simple movements of the tissue graspers, scissors and needleholders could be done by robots.\n\n We know from the automobile industry that manual production from the beginning was the base; nowadays, it is a thing of the past. Highly sophisticated cars can be produced using robots only. Robotics in the automotive industry are today standard; thirty years ago, robots were unknown. Progress in this area has been enormous and has now invaded the realm of surgery. By the end of the twentieth century, the first robotic operations on humans will have been performed-no more manual variable dexterity dependent on physical and psychological components. Shouldn't these irregular components also be improved upon with the precision that only a computer can achieve in surgery?\n\n As an example, I would like to mention the bypass operation, which was performed a few weeks ago in the Saint Pierre University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, described in detail with excellent photographs in the September special issue of LIFE Magazine, edited by Robert Friedmann.\n\n At robotic operations, the surgeon will sit upright in front of a monitor, and his finger movements on virtual instruments will be translated into a computerized message to the robot, who will carry out the action.

At the end of the second millennium, surgery has indeed changed. Today, however, robotic surgery faces only two great problems to secure its future: funding and time.\n\n Pelviscopic surgery was its pacemaker, and it has allowed us to progress to a point half-way to what I am sure will be the surgery for the third millennium: Robotic Surgery. Computerized surgery will replace the surgeon's ten-finger, freestyle battle in the broadly opened cavities of the human body! The surgeon will no longer have to be present in the operating room, and doctors will only be present for emergencies.\n\n The surgeon's brain is in command and manipulates only virtual instruments. The computer has not only the surgeon's input, but also compares his actions with the very latest available information pertaining to the operation. Loaded with this collective knowledge, the computer drives the robot.\n\n The work performed may be viewed throughout the world on multiple screens-even on the moon!

These trials have shown that mTOR inhibitors are well tolerated and may induce prolonged stable disease and tumor regressions in cancer patients [34] . Apoptosis-based therapies gained interest as promising experimental treatment strategies, since direct induction of apoptotic cell death can overcome many of the classical resistance mechanisms such as activated DNA repair or detoxification. The death ligand TRAIL/Apo2L might be a useful tool to trigger apoptosis in cancer, since TRAIL kills tumor cells of diverse cellular origin without ISRN Oncology 3 severe toxic side effects [35, 36] . However, despite the common expression of death receptors, not all glioblastoma cells are susceptible to TRAIL due to intracellular blockage of apoptotic signalling cascades. Therefore, overcoming apoptosis resistance becomes an urgent need in order to sensitize tumors to the actions of death receptor-targeting therapy. A novel group of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) modulating agents sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [37] . One of these drugs, troglitazone, is an oral antidiabetes drug, which belongs to the group of thiazolidinediones. It has been reported that glioblastoma cells are sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by troglitazone via various mechanisms. Troglitazone led to a marked downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins FLIP and survivin. Moreover, in some cell lines, the cell surface expression of agonistic and antagonistic TRAIL receptors was altered towards a higher susceptibility to death receptor induced apoptosis. Troglitazone could counteract the capability of tumor cells to become resistant to apoptosis by modulating the apoptotic machinery at different levels [37] . Constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway also enables cancer cells to resist cytotoxic insults [38] . These changes also affect tumor necrosis factor, Fas, and TRAIL receptors, which play important roles in tumor resistance to apoptosis during cancer progression [36] .\n\n While highly resistant to therapeutic apoptotic stimuli, GBM tumor cells exhibit the paradoxical propensity for extensive cellular necrosis. Necrosis, in fact, is the most prominent form of spontaneous cell death in GBM, presented as foci of necrosis surrounded by broad hypercellular zones contiguous with normal tissue or by parenchymal infiltrates [39] . While limited blood supply and anoxia due to a microthrombotic process has been identified as an important cause of necrosis, the molecular basis for this necrotic phenotype, particularly in the context of intense apoptotic therapy resistance, has recently received attention with the discovery and characterization of the Bcl2-like 12 (Bcl2L12) protein.\n\n Bcl2L12 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of apoptosis that is significantly overexpressed in primary GBMs [40, 41] . Bcl2L12 is a proline-rich protein characterized by a Cterminal 14-amino-acid sequence with significant homology with the BH (Bcl-2 Homology) 2 domain found in several members of the Bcl-2 protein family [37] . RNAi-mediated knockdown of Bcl2L12 sensitizes human glioma cell lines to drug-induced apoptosis and reduces tumor formation in an orthotopic transplant model in vivo [40] . The anti-apoptotic actions of Bcl2L12 is due to its ability to neutralize effector caspase activity likely through specific interaction with effector caspase-7 [42] . These activities of Bcl2L12 are relevant to the necrotic process in the light of studies demonstrating that the suppression of caspase activity redirects the death program from apoptosis to necrosis [42] suggesting that post-mitochondrial caspase activation may act as a molecular switch between apoptosis and necrosis. In support of this findings, germline deletion of post-mitochondrial apoptosis signaling components, such as the caspase activator Apaf-1, or blockage of effector caspase by pan-specific caspase inhibitors results in decreased apoptosis, with concomitant increase of necrosis [42] . On this basis, the upregulation of Bcl2L12 as a novel regulator of the apoptosis/necrosis balance in glial cells may represent an important event in malignant glioma pathogenesis.", "qa": [["80_18809605_2_1", "What are mTOR inhibitors and how are they being evaluated in clinical trials?\n", "mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its derivatives, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated an increase in gingival inflammation without accompanying an increase in plaque levels during puberty. 38 There is a higher incidence of black-pigmented bacteroides and higher populations of other Gram-negative rods in the subgingival microflora compared with healthy sulci in puberty. 39 Especially, there is an increased prevalence of certain bacterial species, such as Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga species. 40 Both estradiol and progesterone have been shown to selectively accumulate by P.intermedia as a substitute for vitamin K, and thus postulated to be acting as a growth factor for this microorganism. 41 Capnocytophaga species have also been noted to increase in number as well as proportion in the subgingival milieu during puberty and have been shown to correlate with an increased bleeding tendency.\n\n \n\n \u2022 Increased gingival inflammation without accompanying an increase in plaque levels 39 \u2022 Increased prevalence of certain bacterial species such, as P. intermedia and Capnocytophaga species.\n\n \n\n The onset of increased production, and secretion of estrogen and progesterone in a cyclic pattern accompanies the onset of puberty and is referred to as the reproductive or menstrual cycle.

This provisional matrix protein contributes to adenoma formation through a mechanism that is specifically dependent on the leukocyte integrin \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 binding motif known to control both leukocyte activation events and apoptosis in vitro (24, 25) . Fibrin(ogen) supports early inflammatory events (e.g., local elaboration of cytokines and epithelial damage) in AOM/ DSS-challenged mice that are coupled to epithelial hyperplasia and secondary transformation events leading to CAC. The presence of fibrin matrices is not sufficient to advance the progression of CAC. Rather, fibrin(ogen)-\u03b1 M \u03b2 2 interactions are critical to promote colitis and CAC, and this seems to be achieved through mechanisms that control both the incidence and ultimate growth of adenomas.\n\n Fibrin matrices are a common feature of many tumors and have been proposed to support tumor stroma formation and An unchallenged colon cut in the same plane is shown for comparison.

This notion is consistent with studies showing that fibrin(ogen) can control numerous cellular processes important for tumor growth, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, growth factor and cytokine elaboration, and cell migration (26, 27) . However, prior studies in fibrinogendeficient mice established the somewhat enigmatic finding that fibrin(ogen) was entirely dispensable for the robust growth of transplantable tumor cell models (e.g., Lewis lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma; refs. 17, 28) . Here, we directly show that fibrin(ogen) is a crucial determinant of tumor development/outgrowth in the context of a distinctly inflammation-driven tumor model developing in situ. Therefore, a primary distinguishing feature determining the fibrin(ogen) dependence of tumor formation/growth in some contexts (e.g., CAC) but not others (e.g., transplantable tumor models) may be the fundamental requirement for local, fibrinsupported inflammatory events. Although inflammatory cells may contribute to the growth of transplantable tumors, this may be driven by the direct production of inflammatory mediators by fully transformed tumor cells independent of peritumoral fibrin (29) . An intriguing concept that remains to be fully explored is that fibrin indirectly supports the accumulation of tumor cell transformation events and growth through the control of local inflammation-associated proliferative signals.\n\n The data presented here show that the fibrin(ogen) \u03b1 M \u03b2 2 binding motif promotes early inflammatory events in colitis coupled to the later development/outgrowth of adenomas. Fibrin(ogen)-\u03b1 M \u03b2 2 interactions could support the early inflammatory response in colitis through several mechanisms.

Antimicrobial PDT has pivotal advantages in comparison with chemotherapeutics, such as no potential to induce resistance, and a wide spectrum of activity extended to saprophytes, pathogen bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and protozoa. RLP068-PDT has been observed to reduce the microbial load in DFUs and has shown a trend towards accelerated wound healing.

This regimen can loosen thick, tenacious oral secretions, and alleviate pain due to mild mucositis. [12] Amifostine is a drug that can reduce the incidence of xerostomia in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Although it is the only pharmacologic agent with established efficacy in the prevention of xerostomia, its role in patient management is uncertain and the use of amifostine is not standard. For patients that have lasting post-radiation xerostomia, pilocarpine may be used to stimulate saliva production from residual salivary gland tissue. However, pilocarpine is not recommended to prevent xerostomia in patients receiving RT for head and neck cancer.\n\n From the second or third weeks onwards, almost all patients undergoing head and neck cancer RT will experience mucositis. Radiation-induced loss of stem cells in the basal layer interferes with the replacement of cells in the superficial mucosal layers when they are lost through normal physiologic sloughing. The subsequent denuding of the epithelium results in mucositis, which is painful and will interfere with oral intake and nutrition. Mucositis is managed symptomatically. Good oral hygiene is imperative. Dietary modification will be necessary, and topical agents for superinfections and pain may be required. The patient should avoid acidic or spicy foods, sharp foods (eg, chips), caffeine, alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Secondary bacterial, fungal (oral candidiasis), and viral (herpes) infections should be treated with appropriate agents. Localized mouth pain can be treated with topical anesthetics ( example 2 % viscous lidocaine). This may be combined with an antacid suspension (Mylana,Maalox, Gelusil) and/or diphenhydramine (for local drying effect). Dexamethasone solution (an anti-inflammatory), tetracycline suspension (antibiotic) or nystatin (antifungal) may also be added to the mixture.\n\n An abnormal or impaired sense of taste ( the sense of taste may also be affected by impaired olfaction). An altered sense of taste and/or smell may contribute to nutritional difficulties and weight loss; 67% of patients treated by RT have dysgeusia. There is no successful treatment for this problem and dietary counseling should be instituted to counteract a lack of appetite.\n\n Long-acting opiates (oxycontin, levorphanol, oxymorphone) should be used as needed during the treatment period. For patients who cannot swallow oral medication, transdermal fentanyl may provide good pain relief. Short-acting opiates (morphine, codeine, oxycodone) should be used for breakthrough pain.\n\n Limited jaw opening during therapy is typically secondary to pain. For that reason, passive motion devices are generally not used during radiotherapy. By contrast, passive motion devices (TheraBite, E-Z Flex) can generally be instituted early in the postoperative period. Adequate pain control will be necessary.\n\n One of the most serious complications of radiation therapy is postradiation treatment necrosisosteoradionecrosis. This is generally a delayed onset disease that usually takes significant radiation to develop and manifests itself after the irradiated area is subjected to dental surgery, trauma and ongoing periodontal infection. [13] [14] [15] Although osteoradionecrosis is closely associated with above mentioned factors, spontaneous appearance of the disease is not unusual with documented incidence in the literature. [16] The incidence of osteoradionecrosis is variable with 2.6% to 22% for the mandible with significantly lower incidence in the maxilla. [17, 18] The precise mechanism of injury is still unknown but the progression the disease begins with a slow change in the matrix of bone after irradiation. The initial changes result from injury to the remodeling system, i.e. the osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts tend to be more radiosensitive than osteoclasts, leading to increase in the initial destruction of bone. [19, 20] The later changes result from alterations of the vascular system itself; causing fundamental damage to bone architecture. Radiation injury to the fine vasculature of the bone first leads to hyperemia, followed by endarteritis, thrombosis, and progressive occlusion and obliteration of the small vessels.", "qa": [["80_32927838_2_1", "What are some management strategies for mucositis in patients undergoing head and neck cancer radiotherapy?\n", "Some management strategies for mucositis in patients undergoing head and neck cancer radiotherapy include good oral hygiene, dietary modification, and the use of topical agents for superinfections and pain.

Accordingly, the present results extend these earlier findings.\n\n In many physiologic systems underlying pathology is not obvious under baseline conditions but can be revealed when the system is stimulated. It is well known that stimulation of nAChRs on glutamatergic neurons leads to increased release of glutamate Wonnacott, 1997; Gentry and Lukas, 2002) . Importantly, Figure 4 . Note that the size and frequency of events is similar in the control and DNE cell at baseline. However, during acute nicotine challenge, mEPSC frequency increased in control cells but not in DNE cells. chronic nicotine exposure is associated with both an upregulation and long-term desnensitization of nAChRs in many neuron types (Wonnacott, 1990; Gentry and Lukas, 2002) , including XIIMNs (Pilarski et al., 2012; Wollman et al., 2016) . Accordingly, we also studied glutamatergic synaptic transmission while nAChRs were activated with an acute nicotine challenge. Whereas nicotinic stimulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission was the same in control and DNE pups studied on P1 and P2, there were significant treatment effects in P3-P5 animals. In P3-P5 control animals, acute nicotine challenge increased the frequency of both sEPSCs and mEPSCs, while the frequency of sEPSCs decreased in the DNE animals. Importantly, the stimulation of mEPSCs by acute nicotine challenge in control preparations indicates that nicotine is likely acting on the presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic neurons that impinge on the motoneurons. The stimulation of sEPSC frequency could involve other sites of nicotine's action, including the soma or dendrites of glutamatergic neurons or neurons presynaptic to them. Nic-otine challenge did not affect the mEPSC frequency of P3-P5 DNE preparations. Thus, the stimulatory effect on axon terminals at earlier stages may be blunted and/or the reduction in sEPSC frequency in P3-P5 animals reflects sites of action other than the presynaptic terminals. Although the mechanisms responsible for the qualitative change in nicotinic control of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in P3-P5 animals is unknown, we hypothesize that this is part of the compensatory response to the increased excitability in XIIMNs from nicotine exposed animals (Pilarski et al., 2011; Jaiswal et al., 2013) . The P3to P5-d delay may reflect the time needed to establish compensatory mechanisms after birth, which is accompanied by a sudden demand for tongue muscle activation to support suckling, licking, and swallowing (Thiels et al., 1990) . Strategies that neural systems use to compensate for increased excitability could include reducing dendrite volume, increasing pre and/or postsynaptic inhibitory input, or reducing excitatory input. There is evidence that all three adjustments occur in XIIMNs from DNE animals. 0.0001; B) . In cells from animals aged P3-P5 (C, D), acute nicotine challenge caused a significant left shift of glutamatergic mEPSCs in control cells (p \u03ed 0.004; C), but there was no change in the distribution of IEIs in DNE cells (p \u03ed 0.066; D). Arrows indicate the direction of the shift with acute nicotine challenge and indicates significant differences with K-S test (see Materials and Methods). Dotted gray lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals of each curve.\n\n First, the dendritic tree in XIIMNs from DNE animals is larger and more complex than that of controls on P1-P2, but is smaller and less complex by P3-P4 (Powell et al., 2016) , indicating changes in the timing of growth and pruning of XIIMNs due to DNE. Similarly, DNE may alter the growth and pruning of specific populations of glutamatergic neurons in this region, which could result in altered responses to acute nicotine challenge as seen here.", "qa": [["61_207954057_10_1", "How does acute nicotine challenge affect glutamatergic synaptic transmission in control and DNE animals?\n", "Acute nicotine challenge increases the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs) in control animals aged P3-P5.

Some doubt must be expressed as to whether levels under .005-.01 ,ugm/cc can be accurately identified as 5-HT. Furthermore, data obtained by techniques utilizing relatively purified extracts of 5-HT, may be looked upon with considerably more confidence than those derived from raw body fluids. This problem of the use of raw fluids in bioassay procedures will be discussed again below.\n\n Chapman and Wolff`have reported the presence of a proteolytic enzyme in the CSF of patients with active inflammatory or degenerative central nervous system disease, migraine headaches, prolonged pain, and chronic schizophrenia. This protease is identified by virtue of its capacity to form what appears to be a biologically-active polypeptide (bradykinin) when CSF is incubated with a globulin-containing solution. The polypeptide is assayed on rat uterus or guinea pig ileum. Sometimes the CSF seems to contain the polypeptide even without incubation with globulin which the authors attribute to the action of the protease on CSF globulins in 7nvo.\n\n Many biologically active polypeptides have been detected in body fluids and tissues, and have been the subject of much investigation.' One of them, Substance P, is found in appreciable amounts in the brain and has been considered as a possible neurohumoral transmitter. Posterior pituitary substance mentioned previously as frequently reported in CSF, is now known to be a mixture of several polypeptides with different pharmacological effects that are found in the neurosecretory elements of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamic-hypophysed tract. The possible relationship of local neurosecretion to brain function is of much interest but beyond the scope of this review.\n\n The chaotic mass of data reviewed above does not lend itself readily to critical analysis. Furthermore, the fact that there is no real understanding of the normal role played by neurohumors in the CNS complicates the problem still more. Nevertheless, the author feels that investigating the patterns of neurohumors in CSF offers a parameter for study that may directly reflect the dynamics of brain function, and should be pursued in spite of the lack of clarity of the field.\n\n The data reviewed on 'posterior pituitary-like' substances in CSF clearly indicate that an agent (or agents) with diverse pharmacological effects appears in increasing concentration in CSF when certain CNS stimuli are applied. Reinvestigation of this problem should be attempted in light of our extensive knowledge of the properties of neurohumors as well as polypeptide hormones.\n\n The presence of measurable Ach in CSF has been clearly established in many experimental and clinical situations, although the levels found vary greatly. The association of increased Ach levels with craniocerebral trauma and epilepsy seems definite. It has been felt that this represents a massive release of Ach from neurons secondary to trauma or seizure activity. This is certainly true of trauma, but one might speculate whether epileptics are frequently releasing excessive amounts of Ach that is a sign of their predisposition to seizures. The fact that elevated Ach levels have been found in the CSF of epileptics during interictal periods' would support such a hypothesis. There is some evidence that convulsions produced by electroshock therapy do not produce Ach elevations as readily as naturally occurring seizures do.\"' The data on choline acetylase activity in epileptogenic cortex has been contradictory,' but the increasing emphasis at present on techniques of studying particulate (bound) Catecholamines in CSF undoubtedly reflect plasma levels of these substances. 5-HT in blood is almost entirely bound to platelets, and it is not surprising that 5-HT is not as readily detectable in CSF as are catecholamines. Where 5-HT is found, it would be worthwhile to study the sediment of centrifuged CSF to see if the cellular elements are the source of 5-HT, as seems to be often true of histamine.'\n\n A few other suggestions regarding further investigations of this type may be made. Although the surveys of heterogeneous patient groups described above are initially necessary, continued advances will now probably come as the result of sustained studies of specific pathological states where promising leads have been found. One such area is the association of Ach in CSF with convulsive disorders.", "qa": [["76_18438110_4_1", "What are some factors that may hinder the accurate assessment of serotonin (5-HT) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?\n", "Factors that may hinder the accurate assessment of serotonin (5-HT) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) include the lower limits of sensitivity of the assay methods used, doubts about accurately identifying levels under .005-.01 ugm/cc as 5-HT, and the use of raw body fluids in bioassay procedures."], ["76_18438110_4_2", "What is the possible relationship between elevated acetylcholine (Ach) levels in CSF and craniocerebral trauma and epilepsy?\n", "Elevated acetylcholine (Ach) levels have been associated with craniocerebral trauma and epilepsy.
