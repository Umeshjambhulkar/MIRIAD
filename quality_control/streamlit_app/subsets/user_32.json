Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

However, its clinical use is limited due to its side effects of severe cardiotoxicity and heart failure. In particular, the symptoms of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) can last for many years in children treated with DOX [1] . Dexrazoxane is the only cardioprotectant approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in DIC. However, it has been proven that dexrazoxane can induce secondary malignancies [2] and aggravate myelosuppression [3] . No matter whether these reports are solid or not, seeking novel strategies involving combinational usage of agents to minimize associated cardiotoxicity and increase chemotherapeutic efficacy should be at the forefront of cross-discipline research which combines oncology and cardiology research. Numerous studies have explored the molecular mechanisms of DIC, and several molecular elements, including DNA damage, mitochondrial damage, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DIC [4] . However, an explicit and unifying model of the pathogenesis of DIC remains undefined.\n\n Autophagy is a vital cell survival mechanism in which cells degrade and recycle damaged/old organelles and misfolded proteins within lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis [5, 6] . It is becoming evident that altered autophagic activity is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases, especially DIC and DIC-caused heart failure [4] . Autophagy involves the synthesis of a double-membrane autophagosome, which is initiated by UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1). Subsequently, Beclin1 (ATG6) forms a multiprotein complex with Vps34 and UVRAG and this complex is activated by ULK1 to induce autophagosome formation. Protein 1 light chain 3-I (LC3-I), an immature isoform, is lipidated and converted into mature LC3-II via conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). P62, a ubiquitin-binding cargo receptor, engages in segregating proteins, organelles, and other aggregates into the autophagosome. Next, lysosomes fuse with the outer membranes of autophagosomes and autolysosomes are formed. In the last step of autophagy, under the mediation of lysosomal-associated membrane proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2, the autolysosome contents are then degraded by a series of lysosomal proteases [7] which autophagic flux ends. Hence, cooperation of autophagosomes and lysosomes is critical to the autophagy process, with Beclin1 being a key molecule [8] . Moreover, the mTOR kinase is a negative regulator of autophagy which exerts its biological activity through Thr389 p-S6K1. mTOR phosphorylates Ser757 of ULK1 to inactivate Beclin1, leading to the suppression of autophagosome formation [5] . In addition, LAMP, as the biomarker of lysosome biogenesis and function, is critical for orchestrating autophagic flux [1, 9] . mTOR phosphorylates TFEB and results in the sequestration of TFEB in the cytoplasm. Studied have definitively shown that TFEB masters the transcription of target genes closely related to lysosomal biogenesis and function, including hydrolases and LAMP1, whereas impaired nuclear localization of TFEB causes the decline of lysosomal biogenesis and function [10, 11] . Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the dysregulation of Beclin1/LAMP1 is involved in DIC [1, 7, 12] . The Beclin1/LAMP1-mediated autophagy pathway has emerged as a potential target for treating DIC.

In patients intolerant of, or with contraindications for, metformin, select initial drug from other classes depicted and proceed accordingly. In this circumstance, while published trials are generally lacking, it is reasonable to consider three-drug combinations other than metformin. Insulin is likely to be more effective than most other agents as a third-line therapy, especially when HbA 1c is very high (e.g., $9.0%). The therapeutic regimen should include some basal insulin before moving to more complex insulin strategies (Fig. 3) .

Advancing to triple combination therapy. Some studies have shown advantages of adding a third noninsulin agent to a two-drug combination that is not yet or no longer achieving the glycemic target (83) (84) (85) (86) . Not surprisingly, however, at this juncture, the most robust response will usually be with insulin. Indeed, since diabetes is associated with progressive b-cell loss, many patients, especially those with long-standing disease, will eventually need to be transitioned to insulin, which should be favored in circumstances where the degree of hyperglycemia (e.g., $8.5%) makes it unlikely that another drug will be of sufficient benefit (87) . If triple combination therapy exclusive of insulin is tried, the patient should be monitored closely, with the approach promptly reconsidered if it proves to be unsuccessful. Many months of uncontrolled hyperglycemia should specifically be avoided. In using triple combinations the essential consideration is obviously to use agents with complementary mechanisms of action ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.) . Increasing the number of drugs heightens the potential for side effects and drug-drug interactions, raises costs, and negatively impacts patient adherence. The rationale, benefits, and side effects of each new medication should be discussed with the patient. The clinical characteristics of patients more or less likely to respond to specific combinations are, unfortunately, not well defined. Transitions to and titrations of insulin. Most patients express reluctance to beginning injectable therapy, but, if the practitioner feels that such a transition is important, encouragement and education can usually overcome such reticence. Insulin is typically begun at a low dose (e.g., 0.1-0.2 U kg 21 day 21 ), although larger amounts (0.3-0.4 U kg 21 day 21 ) are reasonable in the more severely hyperglycemic. The most convenient strategy is with a single injection of a basal insulin, with the timing of administration dependent on the patient's schedule and overall glucose profile (Fig. 3) .\n\n Although extensive dosing instructions for insulin are beyond the scope of this statement, most patients can be taught to uptitrate their own insulin dose based on several algorithms, each essentially involving the addition of a small dose increase if hyperglycemia persists (74, 76, 88) .", "qa": [["86_54784352_6_1", "What are the treatment options for patients who do not achieve the HbA1c target after three months?\n", "The treatment options for patients who do not achieve the HbA1c target after three months include a sulfonylurea, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin.

The safety of sugammadex has been assessed in the phase I and II studies (in a total of 86 subjects). In one study, sugammadex was administered to awake volunteers who had received no neuromuscular blocking drugs (38) . The most frequently reported side effects have been hypotension (three subjects), coughing (three subjects), movement (three subjects), nausea (three subjects), vomiting (three subjects), dry mouth (four subjects), parosmia (an abnormal smell) (two subjects), a sensation of a changed temperature (three subjects), and abnormal levels of N-acetylglucosaminidase in the urine (five subjects) (38, 40, 41) . In one study, prolongation of the corrected QT interval was noted in five subjects who received placebo and in three subjects who received sugammadex (38) . \n\n What can we look forward to? Does the introduction of sugammadex herald the elimination of many of the shortcomings in our clinical practice with regard to antagonism of neuromuscular blockers? The deep levels of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium (and possibly by vecuronium, although there is no clinical evidence for the latter drug yet) can be promptly antagonized with appropriate doses of sugammadex. This should make surgical care much easier and safer: Surgeons should no longer encounter inadequate muscle relaxation, and anesthesiologists should no more encounter patients whose neuromuscular blockade is hard to reverse at the end of surgery. The introduction of sugammadex into clinical practice would thus contribute to both increased patient safety and improved surgical conditions. One expects to see no more patients either being held in the operating room because the antagonism of residual neuromuscular blockade is incomplete, or being transferred to postoperative care units with residual neuromuscular blockade. Additionally, no anticholinesterase or anticholinergic drugs would be needed for the antagonism of residual neuromuscular blockade, which would mean the end of the cardiovascular and other side effects of these compounds (17) . The postoperative nausea and vomiting associated with the use of these compounds should also be eliminated (52) . Will sugammadex replace neostigmine as an antagonist for rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade? Kopman (53) rightly believes that this will \". . . depend at least in part on economic considerations.\" Although concerns have been raised about the acquisition cost of new drugs (54), the economic evaluations are complex, and not simply defined by the acquisition cost (55) . In the final analysis, improvements in inpatient outcome must have a dollar value that offsets the cost of the drug (56).\n\n Do we still need to use neuromuscular function monitoring with sugammadex? Without knowing the depth of the rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, it would be difficult to know the dose of sugammadex needed. Perhaps conventional nerve stimulators would be sufficient to determine the presence or absence of the twitch response, and the appropriate dose of sugammadex could be administered accordingly. In such circumstances, objective neuromuscular monitoring would no longer be needed.\n\n Further, the use of rapid-sequence induction with rocuronium can be facilitated by the presence of sugammadex. The previously described sequence of 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium followed 3 min later by 16 mg/kg sugammadex seems to provide a faster onsetoffset profile than that seen with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine. If the rocuronium induction/sugammadex reversal paradigm achieves the reliability of succinylcholine, will this mark the end of years of effort directed toward developing a nondepolarizing version of succinylcholine? Why would one ever give succinylcholine if one could give rocuronium and achieve reversal more quickly than the succinylcholine would wear off? Before these questions can be answered, however, we must know whether the rocuronium-sugammadex sequence will be safer than succinylcholine? In this regard, studies using succinylcholine have indicated that the risk of desaturation in the immediate postinduction period is much greater than initially recognized in \"cannot intubate, cannot ventilate\" situations (57, 58) . Nevertheless, studies are needed to address the role of sugammadex as a \"rescue\" reversal drug in patients with unanticipated difficult airways who received rocuronium. For now, succinylcholine is expected to remain on the hospital formulary, but its clinical use will most likely become limited to reparalyzing patients who have already received sugammadex.\n\n The introduction of propofol almost two decades ago changed anesthetic practice (34) . Nothing since then, however, has had the same effect. Unquestionably, the introduction of sugammadex is an important breakthrough, and one that is likely to change the face of clinical neuromuscular pharmacology. This molecule is specifically suited to rocuronium and vecuronium, and its future clinical use should decrease the incidence of postoperative muscle weakness caused by these drugs and facilitate the use of rocuronium for rapid sequence induction of anesthesia. For now, however, we still need benzylisoquinolinium neuromuscular blockers in our practice, so the residual postoperative muscle weakness caused by this class of drugs is likely to continue unless objective neuromuscular function monitors are routinely used, or until a molecule capable of binding to benzylisoquinolinium neuromuscular blockers is discovered.", "qa": [["84_45662_4_1", "What are the potential benefits of using sugammadex in clinical practice?\n", "The introduction of sugammadex into clinical practice is expected to improve surgical care by promptly antagonizing deep levels of neuromuscular blockade induced by drugs like rocuronium.

This observation suggests that hydrogen-related defects correlate with nitrogen impurities. Nitrogen doping promotes {100} faceted growth. Orange to orange red luminescence and striations are typically observed for N-doped CVD diamond. These striations are a result of a different uptake of impurityrelated defects on the risers and terraces of surface growth steps (9) . The a-C:H peak at 2930 cm \u03ea1 occurs in the region that corresponds to absorption of C-H groups on {100}. In hydrogen-rich natural diamond, hydrogen is incorporated mostly in cuboid sectors (35) . The 370 nm band is present in brown cuboid sectors while absent in gray octahedral sectors in the same diamond (35) . Hydrogen may be incorporated into NV \u03ea complexes on {100} in CVD diamond during its growth. NVH \u03ea is a common defect in nitrogen doped SC-CVD diamond and can be present in higher concentrations than the NV centers (21) . It has been proposed that hydrogen atoms are bonded to the nitrogen, and the unpaired electrons located in the dangling bonds of the three equivalent nearest-neighbor carbon atoms, with very little localization on the nitrogen (20) . EPR spectra show that the NVH \u03ea centers exist in our as-grown nitrogen doped CVD diamond and that they are removed by both the LPHT and HPHT treatment. Concentrations of paramagnetic defects follow the sequence N s 0 \u03fe NVH \u03ea \u03fe NV \u03ea (unpublished data) (8) . The intensities of the three UV-visible absorption bands follow the order 270 nm (N s ) \u03fe 370 nm (unknown) \u03fe 550 nm (possibly NV related). The NVH \u03ea centers may also be associated with the 3124 cm \u03ea1 feature and the near-IR hydrogen-induced electronic absorption. The 370 nm emission was observed in brown CVD diamond after irradiation and its intensity increased as the nitrogen intensity increased in local areas (7) .\n\n The susceptibility of the electron-phonon vacancy related color centers to LPHT processing makes it possible to reduce broad visible absorption of the CVD diamond produced at high growth rates. Movement of hydrogen atoms from the unstable hydrogen-incorporated centers (e.g., NVH \u03ea ) to more stable C-H bonds can explain the dramatic enhancement in optical transparency of this diamond. We also note that the SC-CVD diamond can endure longer annealing times than polycrystalline CVD diamond without graphitization.\n\n Processing SC-CVD diamond at LPHT has been shown to be effective in enhancing the optical properties of these crystals, and this treatment provides important insight into the nature of defects and impurities associated with diamond. In contrast to HPHT annealing, this LPHT method is applicable in CVD reactors as a subsequent treatment after growth and not constrained by the size of the crystals. Spectroscopic characterization of LPHT annealed crystals has advanced understanding of the mechanism of annealing. The 370 nm absorption band and increasing absorption continuum toward shorter wavelengths of the as-grown SC-CVD diamond appear to originate from the presence of hydrogen incorporated extended defects (under-bonded carbon or vacancy clusters), which may be decorated with nitrogen forming defect centers (e.g., NVH \u03ea ). The optical enhancement may be attributed to the changes in defect structure associated with hydrogen incorporation during CVD growth. There is a decrease in sharp line spectral features indicating a reduction in NVH \u03ea defects. We suggest that the residual absorption (\u03f7550 nm) of the annealed CVD diamond is associated with the increased concentration of the NV centers as compared with the asgrown material. Because the spin associated with the NV \u03ea complex may have a practical use, and the number of NV \u03ea complexes could be controlled by the LPHT annealing process, the LPHT-annealed SC-CVD diamond could be a promising material for applications such as quantum computing which require detailed information on the concentration and distribution of these complexes.\n\n SC-CVD diamond samples were produced by the MPCVD method described elsewhere (2, 3) . Typically the diamond samples were grown under the following conditions: N2/CH4 \u03ed 0.2-5.0%, CH4/H2 \u03ed 12-20%, total pressures of 120 -220 torr, and temperatures of 900-1500\u00b0C. For the purpose of annealing, a 6 kW, 2.45 GHz microwave plasma CVD system with a redesigned cavity and molybdenum substrate stage was used to generate stable and energetic hydrogen plasmas (2) . SC-CVD diamond plates were heated in the CVD chamber to temperatures in the range 1400\u00b0C to 2200\u00b0C, at pressures between 150 and 300 torr. Typically, samples were heated stepwise to the maximum annealing temperature, kept at the maximum temperature for a chosen time, and ramped down to room temperature. The processing conditions are summarized in Table 1 . Temperatures were measured by an infrared two-color pyrometer. It should be noted that all diamond used in the experiments consisted of high quality single crystal material to prevent significant graphitization and cracking at temperatures \u03fe1600\u00b0C at low pressures outside the diamond stability range, and energetic hydrogen plasma etch (6) .\n\n Samples were characterized before and after LPHT processing by microphotoluminescence (PL), and micro-UV-visible and synchrotron IR absorption spectroscopy. Photoluminescence spectra were measured at 77 K and room temperature by using a custom-built micro Raman/PL system. PL spectra were typically excited by the 488 nm argon-ion laser. The laser power was \u03f750 mW and the focal spot diameter was \u03f75 m. The UV-visible absorption spectra were measured at room temperature with a custombuilt micro UV-visible absorption setup based on an Ocean Optics spectrometer. The spot diameter was \u03f720 m.

Prevalence of chronic renal disease in Pakistan is estimated to be 12.5%. 1 This increasing prevalence is mainly due to diabetes nephropathy (28%), chronic glomerulonephritis (22%) followed by hypertention (14.6%). 2 In spite of having a huge burden of kidney diseases, there is a dearth of normal data on renal vascular anatomy in Pakistani population. 2,3 For kidney failure, kidney transplant is the best choice of treatment modality which gives a good long-term quality of life. Therefore it's extremely necessary for a living donor to avoid complications during surgery, should have a complete renal vasculature evaluation. 4 Renal artery variations have gained significance in the last decades because of the pervasive development in interventional radiological procedures and transplantation surgeries. 5 A study reported, that persons with kidneys having extra renal arteries appear to have higher incidence of renovascular hypertension. 6 Renal arteries supplying kidneys, are paired branches of abdominal aorta. 7 Incidence of a single main renal artery is 70% in individuals. However, accessory renal arteries (ARA) are present in 30% of individuals. [7] [8] [9] ARA are the most important variation of the renal circulatory system, come across in around one third of anatomic dissection. 10 Accessory renal arteries commonly arises from abdominal aorta, but they may arise from the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries and even from common iliac arteries. 8 Accessory renal arteries (ARA) are classified as polar and hilar arteries. Hilar artery enters at the renal hilum along with main renal artery, whereas polar artery DOI: 10.29309/TPMJ/2020. 27 enters the kidney at one of its poles through its surface outside the hilum. 11 Accessory renal arteries are regarded as persistent embryonic lateral splanchnic arteries. Extra renal arteries are vestigial structures that develop due to failure to degenerate, during ascent of primordial permanent kidney (metanephros). 12 In developing human embryo, permanent kidney which is metanephros ascends from pelvic cavity to abdomen. During its ascent it receives blood vessels close to it. Initially renal arteries are branches of common iliac arteries, later on, they arise from distal end of aorta. When they are located at higher level, they receive new branches from aorta and older vessels degenerate until a single persistent renal artery forms. 13 Catheter angiography which was usually used to visualize arteries, is regarded as a gold standard technique, however its invasive nature decreases its use.

These results suggest that bradykinin enhances the proliferation of human cardiac c-Kit + progenitor cells via activating B2Rs by promoting the G0/G1 boundary to S phase.\n\n To determine whether bradykinin increases cell migration in human cardiac c-Kit + progenitor cells, wound healing and chemotaxis assays were conducted in cells treated with different concentrations of bradykinin. Figure  3A shows the wound healing images in cells treated with vehicle, 10 nM bradykinin or the B2R antagonist HOE140 (30 nM) plus 10 nM bradykinin. Bradykinin increased the cell migration, and the effect was countered by HOE140. Figure 3B illustrates the migrated cells into the acellular area in cells treated with 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 nM bradykinin or 30 nM HOE140 plus 10 nM bradykinin. Bradykinin increased cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner (n = 6, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 vs. control), and the effect was countered by HOE140 (n = 6, P < 0.05 vs. 10 nM bradykinin).\n\n The effect of bradykinin on migration was further determined with transwell assay to limit the potential contamination by cell proliferation. Figure 3C shows the images of migrated cells on the lower surface membrane in cells treated with vehicle, 10 nM bradykinin, and bradykinin plus 30 nM HOE140. The migrated cell number was increased in cells treated with bradykinin, and the effect was reduced by HOE140. The number of migrated cells is illustrated in Figure 3D . The cell migration, as in wound-healing assay, was increased by bradykinin in a concentration-dependent manner (n = 6, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 vs. control), and the effect was countered by 30 nM HOE140 (P < 0.01 vs. 10 nM bradykinin). These results indicate that bradykinin increases the mobility of human cardiac c-Kit + progenitor cells via activating B2Rs.\n\n The effects of bradykinin on cell proliferation, cell cycling progression and mobility were determined in human cardiac c-Kit + progenitor cells with B2Rs silenced.

In this paper, we will present the rest of the key findings which constitute the rest of the artefacts of our proposed method. This section starts with introducing two main set of results obtained through the observation study. The first is the primary processes identified which have been grouped into the formation phase and the acting phase processes. The second is a set of derived design principles to aid the design process of online platforms for peer support groups to combat DA.\n\n This phase focuses on the preparatory measures to form peer groups and manage them effectively, as well as to ensure groups optimal performance.\n\n In the assessment stage and before permitting patients into the peer group therapy and beside the close scrutiny in relation to assessing the problematic behaviour, patients are evaluated thoroughly against certain motivational conditions including: (1) the desire to change, (2) readiness for that, (3) the stage of recovery and (4) the level of dependence. In substance addiction, part of these assessments is performed by a qualified medical doctor. Generally, patients should be joining peer groups on a voluntary basis to maximise the chance of their recovery and also to avoid disrupting others and creating negative group experience.\n\n The assessment also covers the aspects that may influence the treatment programme, e.g., cross-addictions. For instance, a person with smartphone and social network obsessive usage could replace, or even have at the same time other kinds of addictive experiences, such as problem gambling or compulsive online shopping.\n\n The rehab centre used to apply assessment activities iteratively for the purposes of educating patients. This was through the use of self-governed instruments such as the Assessment of Warning signs for Relapse (AWARE) scale [86] which was designed to predict the occurrence of relapse [87] . This family of assessments aims at educating individuals through guiding them to explore past experiences, i.e., warning signs and internal reactions to them, and develop self-management strategies for them. For example, when a group member selects a warning sign like \"Confusion and overreaction: difficulty in managing feeling and emotions\", then with the aid of the given materials, the member can find out their more refined and subtle signs and emotions such as: (1) \"I feel that nobody would care if I tried to explain what made me unhappy\", (2) \"I feel scared to socialise\" (3) \"I isolate myself \" (4) \"I start bringing irrelevant problem to hide the main issue which was in that case, why nobody cares?\". As such, this assessment exercise teaches members to identify the profound and preliminary signs before the main one takes place. The goal is to help patients to avoid relapse before it takes place. This indicates that self-help and confession are essential design principles for online platforms, where patients themselves should contemplate and state the signs. This active role of patients shall have a positive impact on their ownership of their recovery process and goals.\n\n In relation to assessing recovery, i.e., on how to distinguish whether a patient is clean or fully recovered, counsellors consider that \"experts never know but just judge that through behavioural patterns\". Here, Here, it seems more important to have a growing amount of evidence that indicates users' commitment to apply relapse prevention plans and strategies as well as learn effective coping skills. This would help when addictive behaviours take place outside the system environment which makes monitorability more complicated, if not impossible. In DA, this may be the evidence stage where the recovered people may take pictures of social activities and share them with the rest of the group and set up timeframes and usage targets, e.g., in terms of time, location, type and frequency, and adhere to them in a sustainable style.\n\n We conclude that the assessment can be performed as a mixture of self-diagnosis, confession and help-seeking from the patient side and offering tools to facilitate that. The items listed in the AWARE scale proposed by Miller and Harris [86] can help the relapse prediction on online medium, e.g., having trouble in sleeping, self-pitying conversations, overreaction (e.g., through the use of Emoticons) and impulsivity, being always focused and engaged in one activity, and having no clear plans or targets.\n\n In the treatment centre, patients with different addiction themes, e.g., gambling and substance addiction, were offered close principles and treatments. That was under the assumption that addictive behaviours share common variables in terms of initiation, maintenance and symptoms. However, there were parts of the programme which offered to target specific symptoms and behaviours. For example, anger and depression would need further therapeutic treatments, such as emotional support, anger management, changing thinking styles or even teaching some social skills. Such extra treatments can be offered in one-to-one counselling settings following the Motivational Interviewing approach.", "qa": [["10_91187792_9_1", "What are some factors that are considered during the assessment stage before allowing patients to join peer group therapy for addiction?\n", "During the assessment stage, patients are evaluated against certain motivational conditions, including the desire to change, readiness for change, stage of recovery, and level of dependence.

Interestingly, an analysis of the EXCITE trial limited to PD patients (Mallamaci F. et al., unpublished data) showed that the effect of physical exercise on the 6-min walk test in PD patients was identical to that observed in the whole study population. In contrast, the results for the STS test in PD patients were not different in the exercise group compared with the control group, but this could be due to the relatively small number of PD patients in the study.\n\n In conclusion, so far the scientific community has dedicated a huge amount of effort to studying the burden of physical inactivity in dialysis patients [1] , as well as the impact of physical exercise in the same patient population, but these programmes represent important barriers for their diffusion as routine treatment for the following reasons: (i) these programmes are conceived to be performed during dialysis sessions [20] and thus cannot be extended to the PD population, (ii) they are costly and (iii) they are not standardized and include too many types of exercise. The first trial that attempted to generalize (i.e. not Physical activity in kidney diseases ii21 performed during dialysis sessions) physical exercise in the dialysis population is the EXCITE trial. It generates the hypothesis that a simple, home-based, personalized exercise programme is well tolerated, improves physical performance and stabilizes cognitive function in dialysis patients.

For example, a study of nursing practice in a remote Australian community found that managerial, professional and regulatory neglect of the conditions essential for competent nursing required nurses to practice in an amorphous (changing and inconsistent) way. Nurses experienced being 'dropped' in the remote area where practice rules are disregarded and 'no-one sees your practice'; 'crossing' or 'overstepping boundaries' occurred regularly; and practice 'outside the scope of nursing' was expected.

The reported incidence of CS-AKI is variable, and depends on definition of AKI as well as on inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n Reported incidence of CS-AKI defined with the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT; dialysis and AKI-D) ranges from 0.4 to 10.9%, with an average between 1 and 2% [4-8, 14, 15, 18, 20] .

Greater than 70% of cardiothoracic procedures are performed on patients over 65 years of age, and almost 60% of general surgery cases are in older adults [58] . Comorbidities associated with need for surgical treatment or procedures include, but are not limited to, coronary revascularization to treat CHD, ablation techniques for A-fib, gallbladder removal due to cholelithiasis, total knee arthroplasty for degenerative arthritis, and resection of cancers (thyroid, esophageal, gallbladder, colon, renal, breast, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate) [59] .\n\n It is well known that older adults have higher rates of postoperative complications [60] and obesity is potentially an additional risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes in older adults. Surgical complications associated with obesity include poor wound healing, risk of infection, increased duration of surgery, and respiratory difficulties. However, the impact of obesity on general health outcomes after surgery has yielded mixed results, often based on the degree of obesity. A number of studies have shown reduced 30-day postoperative mortality or even improved long-term survival in those generally either overweight or with milder levels of obesity, thus supporting the \"obesity paradox\" [61] . The impact of marked obesity is decidedly detrimental when the BMIs are greater than 40 kg/m 2 and even more so at BMIs greater than 50 kg/m 2 [61] .\n\n Optimal management of comorbid medical conditions is critical during any hospitalization for obese older adults in order to prevent complications that may be mainly caused by obesity. Some of the factors where particular attention should be paid for older hospitalized obese adults include:\n\n 1. Mobility. Ambulating can be difficult for older adults with obesity and even more so when they are faced with illness. Early mobilization should be promoted as soon as possible after surgery and for those recovering from medical illness because this helps older adults maintain functional abilities, experience less pain, less delirium, and shorter hospital stays [62, 63] . Mobility can also prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, which are associated with obesity. Early referral to physical therapy is important for facilitating safe mobility and will promote the use of assistive devices or even the use of sling or sit-to-stand patient lifts that are sometimes essential for those with sarcopenic obesity. Any activity may serve to negate the greater risk for accelerated loss of muscle mass in older adults when subjected to bed rest.\n\n 2. Respiratory conditions. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is considered a disease of obesity and also increases in prevalence with older age [64, 65] . OSA may be prevalent in as much as 41% of those undergoing elective surgery, and the use of a screening tool with high sensitivity, such as the STOP-BANG questionnaire, can help identify those at risk of complications including hypoxemia, pneumonia, respiratory failure, low blood pressure, reduced blood flow to the heart, and A-fib [66] . All patients should be screened so that aggravating factors can be minimized (e.g., over sedation from anesthetic agents, opioid pain medications, and sedative hypnotics) and appropriate interventions can be utilized, such as nocturnal oximetry, semi-upright positioning, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if tolerated. Obesity can cause reduced chest wall compliance and central obesity increases the pressure on the diaphragm from the intra-abdominal organs, making lying supine more difficult and contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue. In the setting of an acute hospitalization, nothing should be done to cause weight reduction as a means to reduce pulmonary complications and, unfortunately, nothing can be done acutely to improve inherent respiratory function. However, with a few weeks to prepare for an elective surgery, respiratory muscle training can reduce postoperative pulmonary complications by improving respiratory muscle strength before surgery and those gains in respiratory strength are maintained after surgery [67, 68] .\n\n 3.

Adipose tissue is very metabolically active and contributes to a chronic inflammatory state that may lead to increased susceptibility to infections [18] .", "qa": [["26_11583137_4_1", "How does obesity impact the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CHD)?\n", "Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CHD).

Sustained interruption of this recirculation cycle may disrupt survival signals and sensitize the cells to combination treatments. It is likely that the dynamic life cycle of CLL could explain why this disease, among other the different B cell malignancies, is the most responsive to B cell signaling blockers. Residual PI3K activity present in immune cells upon PI3K\u03b4 inhibition by CAL101, but not other broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitors, may explain its lack of overt immune suppression upon long-term administration [27, 28] . In addition, evidence from another PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, PI-3065, suggests that patients with solid tumors may also benefit from PI3K\u03b4 inhibition, as inactivation of PI3K\u03b4 hinders tumor growth by circumventing regulatory T cell-mediated immune tolerance [29] . Our group found that a novel PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, X-370, preferentially inhibited survival of primary B cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (B-ALL) cells harboring PI3K-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation via a PI3K-PDK1-MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade. The existence of this signaling pathway may possibly be used to identify responsive B-ALL patients.\n\n The findings from the laboratory bench translated well into bedside treatment and vice versa, leading to the final approval of CAL101. However, the exact mechanisms of PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell type leukemia and possibly solid tumors have not been fully elucidated. A deeper understanding of the modes of action of PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors will provide valuable clues to further validate the PI3K\u03b4-targeting approach and to identify biomarkers capable of stratifying patients who are likely to benefit from the therapy. Moreover, the identification of predictive biomarkers capable of monitoring the efficacy of PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors in clinical is urgently needed for different types of tumors.\n\n PI3K\u03b2 is another ubiquitously expressed class I PI3K in addition to PI3K\u03b1. Overexpression of p110\u03b2 is sufficient to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts, and the knockout of PIK3CB circumvents tumor formation in PTEN-null prostate cancer mouse models. PTEN loss or mutation is detected in a considerable fraction (20%-75%) of tumors, including gliomas, breast, colon, lung, endometrial and prostate cancers. Hence, PI3K\u03b2 has been recognized as a therapeutic target in this subset of solid tumors [30] . TGX221, a PI3K\u03b2-selective inhibitor derived from LY294002, has been a desirable template for further optimization. The TGX221 analogues KIN-193 (AZD6482) and SAR260301 have been developed for the treatment of thrombosis and solid tumors, respectively [31] . PI3K\u03b2 inhibitors have been shown to selectively inhibit the growth of tumor cells and xenografts deficient in PTEN, which prompted a new clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the PI3K\u03b2-selective inhibitor GSK2636771 in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid tumors. However, targeting PI3K\u03b2 in PTEN-deficient tumors may be compromised by tumor heterogeneity, coexisting genetic alterations and micro-environmental factors. For example, the presence of oncogenic RTKs, RAS or PIK3CA mutations may shift dependency partially or totally to PI3K\u03b1 in PTEN-deficient tumors. Moreover, the prolonged treatment of PTEN-deficient tumor cells with a PI3K\u03b2 inhibitor may also shift isoform dependency from PI3K\u03b2 to PI3K\u03b1 [32] . Interestingly, the treatment of glioblastoma cells deficient in PTEN with CAL101, but not PI3K\u03b2 inhibitors, resulted in decreased cell migration [33] . A recent study demonstrated PTEN-mutated endometrial cancer cells are resistant to GSK2636771 and KIN-193, while co-treatment of the PI3K\u03b1-selective inhibitor A66 resulted in a decrease in cell viability [34] . These results suggest that pan-PI3K inhibitors may be more effective in PTENdeficient tumors than isoform-selective inhibitors.\n\n The loss of PIK3CG dampens thymocyte development and T cell viability in mouse models, indicating its role in inflammation. Overexpression of p110\u03b3 initiates oncogenic transformation.

(38) that ductus relaxation could occur with prostaglandin \u00a31 despite a normal arterial oxygen tension, Heymann et 11,1. (39) used the drug successfully in opening the ductus in patients with interruption of the aortic arch and in those with coarctation of aorta with closing ductus; Lang et 11,1. (40) reported similar success.\n\n Prostaglandin E) has been used in the patient with interrupted aortic arch to obtain temporary clinical improvement in the patient's cardiovascular status until a bypass graft could be placed surgically across the interruption. Surgical success with this anomaly, which is invariably lethal if untreated in the first few days of life, is now possible in certain cases because of the improvement obtained with prostaglandin \u00a31.\n\n In a study involving 56 centers (41), prostaglandin E, was used in 492 infants with ductus-dependent anomalies. Prostaglandin \u00a31 provided excellent palliation for the 385 infants with ductus-dependent cyanotic congenital heart disease. Among the 107 acyanotic patients with either coarctation of the aorta or interrupted aortic arch, dilation of the ductus produced clinical improvement in 80% of each group and reduced the pressure gradient from 45 to 9 mm Hg.\n\n It was not until the mid 1960s that investigators of neonatal cardiopulmonary problems recognized that a large ductus arteriosus coexisting with respiratory distress syndrome in the premature infant could be so silent clinically yet aggravate, if not cause, the pulmonary disease in some 15% of premature infants weighing less than 1,750 g (42, 43) . Despite small size and poor condition, many such premature infants who had been unresponsive to digitalis and ventilatory support recovered after surgical ligation of the ductus (44) (45) (46) .\n\n On the basis of knowledge that prostaglandins E) and E 2 dilate the naturally constricted ductus in fetal animals and in neonatal human patients (with a ductus-dependent cardiac defect), Friedman et 11,1. (47) theorized that administration of a prostaglandin inhibitor might constrict the ductus. Flower and Vane (48) had shown that indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase.

(49, 50) demonstrated the usefulness, and the necessity, of the echocardiogram in supporting the diagnosis of ductus and in following the course of the infant with critical cardiopulmonary disease during pharmacologic manipulation of the ductus. Because of the atypical murmur of ductus in the premature infant, pharmacologic closure of the ductus often could be confirmed only by a decrease in the echo-derived ratio of diameter of left atrium to aortic root. As a result, echocardiographs were made available to many neonatal intensive care units, aiding the diagnosis and follow-up of infants with all forms of cardiopulmonary dysfunction (51, 52) .\n\n In a large. multicenter. prospective. randomized study indomethacin has proved to be of value.
