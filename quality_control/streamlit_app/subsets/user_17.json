Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

We induced diabetes in 6-8 week old male C57BL/6J mice by STZ through intraperitoneal injection.

Although the inhibiting effect of the RGPE intake did not achieve statistical significance in the tested individual time points, there was a noticeable trend indicating the potential glucose lowering effect of the RGPE as compared to the control group.

Presacral lymph nodes are primarily part of the internal iliac drainage pathway and are considered regional nodes. The seventh edition of the AJCC staging manual (3) introduced the N1c nodal stage for tumor deposits that are found within perirectal tissues without regional nodal metastasis.

Flowers can be classified as entomophilous, which are pollinated by insects, and anemophilous, which are pollinated by the wind. Of these, the airborne pollen of anemophilous flowers is known to be the primary source of respiratory allergies. Korea has seen an increase in allergy cases, with the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in elementary school students increasing from 2.7% in 1995 to 28% in 2009 and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in preschool children reaching 40.7% in 2009. [1] [2] [3] [4] These figures indicate an increase in the latent risk of pollen allergies and hospital visit. Skin prick tests of patients with allergy symptoms (asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis) in Suwon, Korea during 1999-2008 showed that approximately 20.5% of the patients were sensitized with tree pollens including oak. 5 Oak is the dominant tree species in Korea, and its pollen has the highest sensitivity rate of all allergenic tree species in Korea. 6 Therefore, oak pollen is a major factor influencing the number of daily hospital visits and medication use in Korea. Beggs 7 predicted that future increases in CO 2 will lead to increased pollen output, longer pollen seasons, and greater human exposure to pollen, noting that the strength of both allergy inducement and risk will increase. D'Amato et al. 8 also predicted that the pollen season will become longer as a result of global warming. Pollen allergy forecasting can be considered to be a response to this gradually increasing risk of pollen allergies, and Germany, Japan, Korea, England, the United States, and other countries now provide allergy forecasts for their respective primary pollens.\n\n The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has been providing pollen risk forecasts for pine and oak in the spring and Japanese hop and ragweed in the fall since 2008. The KMA pollen risk model predicts pollen concentrations from weather factors and is based on an initial model developed by Kim et al., 9 which used independent multiple regression models for 7 South Korean cities. To expand on this scope, Kim et al. 4 then developed a model that could make prediction covering all of South Korea through the use of a single model employing robust multiple regression based on a Weibull probability distribution. However, the expanded and unified model still underestimated pollen concentrations and could not predict high concentrations well. In addition, the pollen seasons predicted by this model were longer actually than observed. We believe that the main causes of these problems are that the training data contain more low than high concentrations and the regression model cannot properly model the nonlinear relationship between weather factors and pollen concentrations. To address this, we used a machine learning method called a deep neural network (DNN) model in this study to improve on the existing method by modeling nonlinear relationship between weather factors and pollen concentrations. In addition, a bootstrap aggregating-type ensemble model was incorporated to prevent over-fitting and underestimation of the DNN model.\n\n A DNN is an artificial neural network (ANN) with 3 or more hidden layers and is also known as multilayer perceptron. Previous studies applied ANNs in pollen concentration prediction models, including Grinn-Gofro\u0144 and Strzelczak, 10 who studied Alternaria, Puc, 11 who studied Betula, Iglesias-Otero et al., 12 who studied Plantago, and Astray et al. 13 who studied Castanea. These efforts employed models with a single hidden layer in which the networks were limited in that they were constructed with the data obtained from a single site as the target. Therefore, these models could make predictions pertaining only to that site. In addition, many of these ANN models such as the one proposed by Astray et al., 13 utilized pollen concentration data observed on the previous day, which are generally not available for daily operational forecast.\n\n The goal of the present study is to develop a DNN-based estimation model for oak pollen concentration that can overcome the shortcomings of regression models but maintain the capability of daily operational forecast.", "qa": [["60_207810376_0_1", "What are the common allergic diseases caused by pollen?\n", "Pollen can induce allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, and skin allergies."], ["60_207810376_0_2", "What is the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in elementary school students in Korea?\n", "The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in elementary school students in Korea increased from 2.7% in 1995 to 28% in 2009."], ["60_207810376_0_3", "How does global warming affect pollen seasons?\n", "Global warming is predicted to lead to longer pollen seasons due to increased pollen output, resulting in greater human exposure to pollen."]]}, {"passage_id": "4_33027016_0", "passage": "Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) constitute a very rare entity, affecting mainly the bronchopulmonary system and gastrointestinal tract [1, 2] . Breast localizations are unusual and represent less than 0.1% of mammary cancers and less than 1% of neuroendocrine tumors [1] . Most publications in radiology describe nonspecific suspicious findings and do not indicate consistent imaging characteristics of this particular carcinoma by all the available modalities, including ultrasonography, mammography, and MRI [3] . In pathology, diagnosis is based on morphological criteria and confirmed by the expression of neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin) in more than 50% of tumor cells [4] . There are two forms of breast NEC: the pure form exclusively composed of neuroendocrine cells and the mixed or composite form that is less well-differentiated [2, 4] . The composite form often poses diagnostic difficulties, especially for laboratories lacking immunohistochemical techniques, which explains the extreme rarity of the cases reported by African authors [5] . We report a primary composite neuroendocrine carcinoma in a 13-year-old Togolese girl confirmed by immunohistochemistry. We detail the epidemiological, morphological, and immunohistochemical aspects of this rare tumor.\n\n A 13-year-old girl with no remarkable past medical history and no family history of breast cancer presented with a palpable mass in her right breast, which had been evolving for 7 months. On physical examination, an approximately 4 cm firm and mobile nodule was identified. There were no axillary nodes, skin abnormality, nipple retraction, or abnormal nipple discharge. The nodule was located in the superior-external quadrant of the right breast. Due to her young age, the patient underwent only ultrasonography; no mammography was performed. Ultrasonography showed an oval hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass with microlobulated contours, measuring 3.6 cm \u00d7 2.9 cm \u00d7 2.3 cm, with long transverse axis ( Figure 1 ). The mass was considered as atypical adenofibroma and categorized as ultrasound BI-RADS 3. On the demand of the parents, an ultrasound-guided biopsy with a 16G automatic core needle was performed before surgical ablation. On conventional histological examination, a diffuse tumor proliferation, made up of small round cells with hyperchromatic nucleus and a scant limited amphophilic cytoplasm, massively infiltrating the gland and penetrating the lobules and channels ( Figure 2 ) was observed. This aspect had evoked two diagnoses: primary malignant nonHodgkin's lymphoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. The paraffin blocks were sent to France for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma expressing cytokeratin and membrane epithelial antigen associated with a neuroendocrine population expressing CD56, CD57, and chromogranin A. The leukocyte markers were negative ( Figure 3 ). TTF1 and CDX2 markers were not expressed by the tumor cells. Therefore, the case was a composite form of breast NEC. Abdominal ultrasound and thoracoabdominal CT scan performed excluded any secondary site or any other nonmammary primitive site. The treatment consisted of tumor surgery followed by chemotherapy. The patient died 5 months after diagnosis, owing to local recurrence and metastasis.\n\n NECs are very rare tumors, with an incidence of approximately 0.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, commonly located within the digestive tract. Mammary localization is very rare, accounting for less than 0.1% of all breast cancers and less than 1% of neuroendocrine tumors [1, 5] . Our observation illustrates the diagnostic difficulties encountered in practice by underequipped pathological laboratories in Black Africa (e.g., absence of immunodetection technology and electron microscopy). Indeed, in our case, if the paraffin blocks were not sent to France, the diagnosis of NEC would be impossible to affirm. The lack of adequate technical equipment and advanced technologies in pathology laboratories noticed in the majority of African countries can explain a large part of the extreme rarity of the cases of NEC of the breast reported by African authors [6] . We reported a case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the right breast in a young Togolese girl with fatal evolution. NEC occurrence at this age is rarely described in the literature, it is common in elderly patients, specifically between the sixth and seventh decades [2, 4, 6] .

However, the data supporting the use of PPIs (or H 2 RAs) in doses higher than the standard are weak. Similarly, there is no evidence of improved efficacy by adding a nocturnal dose of an H 2 RA to twice-daily PPI therapy. A notable disconnect between clinical trial data and clinical practice is in the use of PPIs twice daily. Almost all efficacy data on these medications are from once-daily dosing studies, even though the pharmacodynamics of the drugs logically supports twice-daily dosing. Hence, guidance on this issue comes primarily from expert opinion, which is essentially unanimous in recommending twice-daily dosing of PPIs to improve symptom relief in patients with an esophageal GERD syndrome with an unsatisfactory response to once-daily dosing. Patients whose heartburn has not adequately responded to twice-daily PPI therapy should be considered treatment failures, making that a reasonable upper limit for empirical therapy.\n\n Circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. As for the issue of onset of action, this primarily pertains to on-demand therapy. If a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug. The most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H 2 RA or a PPI. Diagnostic testing for esophageal GERD syndromes is invoked in 3 broad scenarios: (1) to avert misdiagnosis, (2) to identify complications of reflux disease, and (3) in the evaluation of empirical treatment failures. The discussion of misdiagnosis and identifying complications of reflux disease usually revolves around the concept of \"alarm features\" that are suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. Important alternative diagnoses include coronary artery disease, gallbladder disease, gastric or esophageal malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, and eosinophilic, infectious, or caustic esophagitis. High-quality evidence supporting the broad utility of alarm features as a diagnostic tool is quite limited. However, individual alarm features with the best performance for identifying esophageal or gastric malignancies are weight loss, dysphagia, and epigastric mass on examination, making it appropriate to evaluate these with endoscopy. A caveat in the endoscopic evaluation of dysphagia is that the endoscopist should have a low threshold for obtaining multiple (preferably at least 5) esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens to evaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n The other broad scenario under which diagnostic testing is performed is in the evaluation of troublesome symptoms that have not adequately responded to empirical twice-daily PPI therapy. Did therapy fail because of troublesome symptoms attributable to reflux that did not resolve with PPI therapy or because the symptoms under consideration are not attributable to reflux? Endoscopy is again the first diagnostic test to consider because it may demonstrate Barrett's metaplasia, stricture, or an alternative upper gastrointestinal diagnosis. After a normal endoscopy, priority should be given to identifying conditions for which an effective alternative therapy exists. In the case of GERD, the only alternative, potentially more effective, therapy is antireflux surgery. High-quality evidence on the efficacy of antireflux surgery exists only for esophagitis and/or excessive distal esophageal acid exposure when PPI therapy is withheld. Another requirement for antireflux surgery is that some peristaltic function be preserved. Finally, it is important to identify alternative diagnoses that may masquerade as GERD: functional heartburn, atypical cases of achalasia, or distal esophageal spasm. Given these priorities, the second diagnostic evaluation should be esophageal manometry and the third should then be to ascertain whether or not there is excessive esophageal acid exposure when PPI therapy is withheld. Whether this examination should be performed with the patient on acid suppressive therapy is debated. The unclear relevance of \"normative\" data for impedance-pH studies performed on PPI therapy makes it difficult to interpret such studies. If normal values are not adjusted, then such an on-PPI study could show an unequivocal PPI nonresponse.

We seek to clarify the underlying principles needed for an understanding of anaesthetic and surgical practice and we do not intend to replace the readily available standard works, which should be used in conjunction with this text.\n\n Practice defines the level of knowledge required for the ODP Level III qualification. It covers the practical aspects of operating department practice, where relevant.\n\n Chapters do not follow the layout of the qualification structure but are grouped instead into areas of related knowledge. There is some intentional duplication to emphasise the importance of a particular subject, particularly when viewed from a somewhat different perspective. National legislation, current at the time of writing, has been included but local policies and protocols have been used as illustrations. Drugs and other substances are referred to by their approved name wherever possible. Alternative names may be found by referring to the British National Formulary or a similar publication.\n\n It was about twenty five years ago that I first managed a training school for Operating Department Assistants (ODAs). The two most difficult aspects of course planning were how much theory did the trainees actually need to know and to what level and depth should those theoretical subjects be taught.\n\n This was a time of great change because ODAs were emerging as a new grade of staff within the theatre team and, for the first time, were undertaking formally approved training with a nationally recognized qualification. Although a syllabus and a final examination were identified, there was no guidance on curriculum development or learning objectives. As a result, course planning tended to vary in quality and relevance in different parts of the country.\n\n Trainee ODAs would often be overwhelmed by the amount of theoretical knowledge it was thought they should acquire and even when fortunate enough to have access to comprehensive medical libraries, few text books were available that were directly relevant to their field of competence. Similarly, teachers from the wide range of disciplines with whom ODAs interacted in the clinical situation would sometimes have difficulty in setting their lectures at an appropriate level. This sometimes resulted in confusion or boredom on the part of the trainees and frustration or near despair on the part of the course managers.\n\n Other qualified staff within the operating department often had great difficulty in accepting ODAs as professionals, partly because their role and qualification was poorly understood. The situation is now very different and it is greatly to the credit of the trainees of that time, their managers and a number of theatre specialists that Operating Department Practitioners (ODPs) have become such valued members of theatre teams today, being highly regarded as skilled and knowledgeable professionals.\n\n One of the hallmarks of professionalism includes the ability to pass onto others skills and expertise. This has been achieved through the example of excellence in personal performance and by sharing knowledge, not only with one's peer group, but also with those from other disciplines. The publication of this book is therefore a highly significant development in that some of the contributors are themselves former ODAs who are now in senior management and education. Nurses have also made a significant contribution and it is appropriate to mention the invaluable part many of them have played as training managers, work-based assessors and verifiers in supporting the development of the generic theatre practitioner of today.\n\n Some of the authors are senior anaesthetists and it is right to acknowledge the enormous contribution that so many of their number have made to the development of ODPs as a professional group. Particular mention should be made of Dr Colin Ince who has masterminded the production of this book from inception to publication with the same dedication and enthusiasm with which he has supported the quality of operating department practice over a period of many years.\n\n Theatre professionals no longer need to rely exclusively on texts primarily written for doctors, nurses and other medico-technical staff. This book, which is wholly relevant to the occupational standards of their qualification, also serves as a valuable resource for those wishing to access the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in Operating Department Practice. In addition it provides a good background to the advance practice units of the extended role (Additionally Accredited Units).\n\n It should be remembered that operating department practitioners are not only the nursing and technical staff who provide non-medical assistance within the theatre team but they are also caring professionals in a wide range of clinical situations throughout the health-care setting. They currently have direct contact with patients in such areas as Recovery Units, Accident and Emergency Departments, Day Care Surgery Units, Intensive Therapy Wards and Resuscitation Teams. Good quality care should be available to all patients wherever they are found and operating department practice therefore incorporates those care standards, which already apply in nursing practice. This is a weighty text, but every chapter has the merit of maintaining the essential link between theory, practice and This book will therefore be a valuable resource for many groups of health care professionals, such as trainee doctors, pre and post-graduate nurses, students of midwifery and medico-technical staff, working in a variety of high dependency fields. Operating department practitioners at all levels of experience and career development will find it an essential and comprehensive reference. It is worth quoting Dr Terry Ryan from Chapter 25 (Emergency and Obstetric Anaesthesia): \"There is no doubt that the experience and training of the entire theatre team will have a major impact upon the outcome of any . . . operation. Without the necessary practical abilities theoretical knowledge is of little value.\"\n\n This text addresses these issues across the whole spectrum of operating department practice and will help to support the maintenance of the highest standards of care, safety and treatment available to patients.\n\n Training and Development Consultant to the NHS in Operating Department Practice 1988 -1996 National Verifier for the NVQ in Operating Department Practice, City and Guilds 1991 -1996 \n\n www.cambridge.org \u00a9 in this web service Cambridge University Press Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-68286-2 -Fundamentals of Operating Department Practice Edited by Ann Davey and Colin S.

Efforts have been made to improve cryopreservation of human spermatozoa and to obtain better gametes after thawing. It is well known that the freeze-thawing process affects the fertile potential of human sperm on several aspects. The freeze and thawing process decrease sperm motility \ufffdlinical Urolog\ufffd \ufffdlinical Urolog\ufffd (2) and sperm penetration into the cervical mucus (3), alter cell membrane fluidity (4, 5) , decrease acrosome integrity (6) and may induce sperm apoptotic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation (7) . Lower fertilization and pregnancy rates are achieved when frozen-thawed spermatozoa are used for intrauterine insemination (8) and conventional in-vitro fertilization (9) . However, it has been shown that similar fertilization and pregnancy rates can be obtained with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using both frozen-thawed and fresh motile spermatozoa (10) .\n\n Indications for sperm banking have expanded in the recent years, but the group of cancer patients in reproductive age deserves special attention. Chemotherapy and radiation are often gonadotoxic and although fertility restoration occurs in about 50% of cancer survivors, permanent sterility is common (11, 12) . Therefore, sperm cryopreservation is recommended before therapy (13, 14) . The main concern, however, is that cancer patients are often urged to start treatment and in most individuals only very few specimens preserved.\n\n Even using modern assisted reproductive techniques (ART), pregnancy rates per attempt are below the 50% rate (10, 15, 16) . Then, many couples require multiple ART attempts in order to achieve a live birth. When frozen-thawed sperm are used for ART, one or more vials have to be thawed until an adequate number of viable sperm are obtained. However, ART procedures require very few gametes, especially ICSI, and the remaining ones are left over and ultimately discharged. Refreezing thawed specimens would provide additional opportunities for conception in men who have banked a limited number of sperm specimens, such as cancer patients and those who have a small supply of donor semen left from a previous pregnancy and wish to use it for siblings.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the resistance of human spermatozoa to cryoinjury in repeated cycles of thaw-refreezing.\n\n \n\n Frozen semen specimens were obtained from 16 subjects who requested disposal from our sperm bank. We included all eligible patients who requested disposal over a 6-year period. Specimens remained in storage for an average time of 2.3 years (interval: 1-6 years). According to the pre-freeze sperm count at the time of banking, specimens were divided as normozoospermic (\u2265 20X10 6 /mL; n = 7) or oligozoospermic (< 20X10 6 /mL; n = 9). Reasons for sperm banking were: (i) enrollment in our ART egg donation program, in which sperm cryopreservation is mandatory to facilitate patient treatment synchronization (n = 8); (ii) vasectomy (n = 3), and cancer (n = 5). All cancer patients had testicular malignancies. Two of them have previously had unilateral orchiectomy at the time of banking and were oligozoospermic, while three banked sperm before surgery and were normozoospermic. We have also divided the specimens according to the existence of cancer (n = 5) or not (n = 11), in order to compare the resistance of repeated freezing and thawing between them. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\n\n At the time of initial freezing, specimens were collected by masturbation after 2-3 days of ejaculatory abstinence into sterile containers.

Although the outcomes for pediatric patients who remain hypotensive despite receiving fluid therapy and vasopressor therapy are not specifically described, the hospital mortality rate for pediatric severe sepsis has been shown to be as high as 25% (1) (2) (3) .\n\n The treatment of septic shock in children involves a progression of interventions, beginning with establishing source control and administering fluids and antibiotics urgently (4) . Hydrocortisone may be administered if adrenal insufficiency is suspected but evidence for efficacy and safety is lacking in this population. If patients do not respond to fluids, vasoactive support is used. Commonly, catecholamine infusions, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine, are first-line agents used in children with septic shock (4) . In the Sepsis Prevalence, Outcomes, and Therapies (SPROUT)study (1) , vasoactive infusions were used in 55% of pediatric patients with severe sepsis, with epinephrine and norepinephrine being the most commonly used medications, at 43% and 42% of patients treated with vasoactive medications, respectively.\n\n There is no robust evidence, however, supporting the use of one agent over the other in children with septic shock. The use of high dose catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, in adult patients with severe hypotension is associated with poor outcomes. Vasopressin is considered as rescue therapy in patients in vasodilatory shock who do not respond to high doses of norepinephrine or other sympathomimetics. The only placebo-controlled study of arginine vasopressin in children showed that children receiving vasopressin had an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline after 1 hour; however, there was no survival benefit. In that study, survival was worse for children receiving vasopressin, though this result was not statistically significant (5) . Angiotensin II is also recommended as potential second-/third-line therapy in the American College of Critical Care Medicine pediatric shock guidelines (4). This recommendation is based on a case report utilizing the bovine angiotensin II formulation (6) . A synthetic human angiotensin II was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, and here we describe the use of angiotensin II infusion in two pediatric patients with septic shock requiring high dose vasopressors who were treated as part of an open-label study (NCT03431077).\n\n A previously healthy 8-year-old male presented to the emergency department secondary to listlessness, tachypnea, and chest pain.

Following presentation to the emergency department, he was admitted to the pediatric ward for noninvasive pulmonary support, where he was found to have a right basilar consolidation consistent with pneumonia on chest radiograph (CXR) ( Fig. 1) .

In the absence of dabigatran, high-dose PCC (300 IU/kg) produced low-grade pulmonary emboli in 5/5 (100 %) of animals. However, when the same dose of PCC was administered to animals previously treated with dabigatran, the frequency of pulmonary emboli was decreased in the presence of dabigatran in a dose-dependent manner (2/5 (40 %) at a dabigatran dose of 75 \u03bcg/kg, 1/5 (20 %) at 200 \u03bcg/kg and 0/5 (0 %) at 450 \u03bcg/kg) [56] .\n\n In a porcine model of coagulopathy with blunt liver injury and no anticoagulation, administration of a four-factor PCC (50 IU/kg) resulted in protracted elevation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimers, and formation of thromboemboli and pulmonary fibrinogen deposits in some animals [68] . Signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation were also shown in 44 % of animals. In contrast, a PCC dose of 35 IU/kg safely improved coagulation parameters and halted blood loss. Furthermore, survival and total blood loss were significantly improved in both PCC groups when compared with control animals [68] .\n\n In contrast to the previous study, the administration of PCCs or aPCCs to pigs after blunt liver injury under high-dose dabigatran appears not to be associated with thromboembolic events. Histopathological assessments showed that there was no thrombus formation in the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys after administration of PCC (25, 50 or 100 IU/kg) [58] or aPCC (25 or 50 IU/kg) [57] .\n\n DOACs such as dabigatran have proven effective in decreasing the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with AF, and in the prevention and long-term treatment of VTE. Although the bleeding risk associated with dabigatran is low, any anticoagulant can cause bleeding. With lifethreatening bleeding in dabigatran-treated patients, urgent reversal of the thrombin inhibitory effects of dabigatran should be considered. The available data indicate that PCCs and aPCCs may be able to reverse dabigatraninduced anticoagulation in a dose-dependent manner. However, we do not have high-level evidence to support the use of PCCs/aPCCs in this setting, so the recommendation to use them is based on haematological principles, animal studies, healthy volunteer studies, an ex-vivo study of 'real-world' patients, and outcomes in a few case reports.\n\n Treatment with PCCs or aPCCs increases the concentrations of several coagulation factors, including prothrombin which has a half-life of 60-72 hours [51] . Thrombin generation may therefore be enhanced for several days after the use of PCCs to treat major bleeding [67] . This may be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. The lack of high-level evidence with PCCs and aPCCs for dabigatran reversal makes it difficult to make dose recommendations, but it appears necessary to use the minimum effective dose. On the other hand, there is evidence that low doses may not be effective in reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, probably because of the need to increase the plasma concentration of thrombin to that of dabigatran [58] . This scenario is complicated by the lack of specific coagulation tests that are routinely available and rapid to perform, with established sensitivity and specificity for guiding the required dose of PCC or aPCC and then monitoring the effects of treatment. There is a clear need for a test that fulfils these criteria. Against this background, it is unsurprising that there are variations between guidelines for the use of PCCs/aPCCs in the management of bleeding among dabigatran-treated patients. Treatment decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis according to clinical judgement, local hospital protocols and product availability. Because of the theoretical thromboembolic risk, it is reasonable to titrate PCCs/aPCCs according to the clinical condition of the patient, starting with an initial dose of 25 IU/kg. However, clinical data are needed to establish the optimum dosing strategy. Because the mechanisms of action of PCCs and aPCCs are similar (both act by increasing thrombin generation), there is no need to use first one and then the other in a step-wise approach to bleeding management. It is essential to remember that the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran may be only one aspect contributing to coagulopathy; the likelihood of coexistent hyperfibrinolysis, dilutional coagulopathy and loss of coagulation factors, etc. [69] require a multi-therapeutic approach. In the future, once the specific reversal agent idarucizumab becomes widely available, this treatment will be considered preferable to PCCs and aPCCs for dabigatran reversal because it has not been associated with a risk of thromboembolic events and has shown no procoagulant effect in various laboratory analyses. The phase III RE-VERSE AD study of idarucizumab showed complete reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes, in patients with serious bleeding or who required an urgent procedure [19] . However, idarucizumab may not be available at every hospital for quite some time. Also, there could conceivably be clinical circumstances under which PCCs or aPCCs might be valuable as part of multimodal therapy, such as when thrombin generation is impaired as a result of trauma-induced coagulopathy [70] , although this needs to be evaluated in clinical studies.\n\n Certainly at present, PCCs and aPCCs are far more widely available than idarucizumab, meaning that their use for emergency reversal of dabigatran among bleeding patients may be warranted. The available data do not provide evidence that either PCCs or aPCCs should be considered preferable to the other.

Sera obtained from rabbits immunized with a control \"toxoid\" lacking alpha hemolysin but prepared in the same manner as the alpha hemolysin toxoid, were used as controls. In this manner it was possible to assess the antigenic effect of any diffuse variant surface antigens which might have been present in the crude toxoid preparations. These experiments were performed in a system containing washed human leukocytes suspended in a 20 per cent concentration of the test serum.\n\n The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 3 . Each bar represents the average of two experiments on separate animals. As noted, preimmunization sera did not opsonize the diffuse variant. Sera from rabbits immunized with the control \"toxoid\" lacking alpha hemolysin did not significantly promote phagocytosis. Sera obtained from rabbits immunized with alpha hemolysin toxoid showed a definite increase in opsonins for the diffuse variant in the fluid system employed, though it did not equal the brisk opsonization induced by sera obtained from animals immunized with diffuse variant heat-killed vaccine.\n\n The current studies indicate that antitoxic and antibacterial factors can be clearly differentiated in the experimental mouse infection produced by the Smith diffuse staphylococcus. While immunization with toxoid prepared from crude culture supernatants protected animals against lethal doses of alpha hemolysin, it did not influence mortality induced by intraperitoneal infection with living staphylococci. Conversely, animals immunized with a heat-killed whole cell vaccine were readily killed with culture supernates rich in alpha hemolysin, but showed striking resistance to otherwise fatal intraperitoneal infection induced by the Smith diffuse variant. Studies on the dynamics of these intraperitoneal infections yielded an explanation for these differences. Immunization with toxoid did not promote early intraperitoneal phagocytosis and thus failed to prevent progressive extracellular multiplication and death. Previous experiments have shown that staphylococci are rapidly phagocytized in the peritoneal cavities of animals receiving Smith diffuse whole cell vaccines (13, 14) .\n\n Studies here and elsewhere have suggested that mice dying of infections produced by the Smith diffuse variant are killed by in vivo elaboration of alpha hemolysin (13, 16) . The manner in which toxoid immunized mice died following infection with this strain closely resembled that seen in non-immunized infected mice or normal mice receiving alpha hemolysin. This apparent paradox appears to be explained by the current observation that antihemolysin disappears from the serum, and free alpha hemolysin can be found at the time of death in the peritoneal fluid of toxoid-immunized animals. Thus it appears that actively multiplying extraceUular staphylococci eventually bind all available antibody, and antitoxic immunity is overwhelmed during progressive infection.\n\n While these studies do not resolve all questions regarding the importance of antitoxic or antibacterial immunity, they do suggest possible explanations for some of the conflicting results. It seems likely that the protection against infection noted in toxoid immunized animals in certain past experiments may have resulted from the administration of significant amounts of preformed alpha hemolysin with the living bacteria at time of challenge (12, 17) . Further, the present in vitro studies indicating that crude alpha hemolysin toxoid can induce opsonizing antibody suggests that some favorable results following toxoid administration may be explained by their capacity to evoke opsonins rather than antitoxin per se. Studies with purified alpha hemolysin (18, 19) may help to settle this problem.\n\n It is now apparent that the Smith diffuse variant, and perhaps certain other staphylococcal strains, possess a surface antigen or antigens retarding phagocytosis (13, 14, 20) . Indirect evidence suggests that similar antigens may be produced during in vivo growth of other more common strains (14, 21) . In the present system, antibacterial immunity which prevented the initia2ion of staphylococcal disease was of more importance in protection than antitoxic immunity directed against an extracellular product of staphylococci produced after infection had been established. Further studies with better characterized substances such as the Smith surface antigen described by Morse (20) may define the role of the cell surface in the in ~vo virulence of other strains of staphylococci. Such studies might also clarify the part played by antibody directed against these surface antigens in immunity to staphylococcal infection.\n\n Antitoxic and antibacterial immunity have been clearly differentiated in the experimental mouse infection produced by the diffuse colonial variant of the Smith strain of Staphylococcus aur~us.\n\n Immunization with crude toxoid protected mice from otherwise lethal doses of alpha hemolysin, but did not alter mortality following intraperitoneal infection with living staphylococci. Conversely, animals immunized with heat killed vaccines were readily killed by culture supernates containing alpha hemolysin, but were strikingly protected from otherwise fatal intraperitoneal infection with viable staphylococci.\n\n Protection was directly related to the ability of the immunizing substance to promote early intraperitoneal phagocytosis of the infecting inoculum. In these studies with the Smith diffuse variant, rapid intraperitoneal phagocytosis was induced by vaccination with whole cell bacterial vaccines but not by alpha hemolysin toxoid.\n\n The technical assistance of Miss Sandra Pickens is gratefully acknowledged.", "qa": [["10_2380954_2_1", "What is the difference between immunization with crude toxoid and heat-killed vaccines in terms of protection against Staphylococcus aureus infection?\n", "Immunization with crude toxoid protected mice from lethal doses of alpha hemolysin, but did not alter mortality following intraperitoneal infection with living staphylococci.

Complications of silicone oil include cataracts, silicone emulsification, and secondary glaucoma, which can negatively affect vision and retinal sensitivity, but could improve after silicone oil removal. However, in our study, we strictly excluded these patients.\n\n Although we excluded patients with secondary glaucoma and the mean preoperative IOP in our study was within normal range, we reported significant decrease in IOP postoperatively. It is known that increased IOP may cause mechanical stress to the fovea, leading to loss of outer nuclear layer cell bodies [13] . us, this decrease in IOP (even though it remained within the normal range) could be a possible explanation for improvement in retinal sensitivity. More recently, a study on macula-on retinal detachment found that increased IOP during SO endotamponade was the most important risk factor for visual loss [14] .\n\n Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of the potential toxic effects of silicone. e dissolution of lipophilic macular pigments in silicone oil may render the macula more susceptible to phototoxicity [4, [15] [16] [17] . Another theory is the loss of the buffering capacity of vitreous, leading to impaired homeostasis and potassium accumulating in the retina with silicone tamponade.\n\n is may cause degeneration of M\u00fcller cells [18] . Moreover, the retro-oil fluid contains elevated levels of cytokines, which may affect retinal function by inducing apoptosis and neuronal degeneration, resulting in retinal thinning [19] .\n\n However, it is not well known which of these hypotheses could be reversible, explaining the significant improvement in retinal sensitivity that occurred after silicone oil removal in our study. An earlier study, which reported improvement in the visual function after silicone oil removal, attributed it, in part, due to continued improvement in the retinal function following successful retinal reattachment [20] .\n\n Several case reports and series have reported unexpected visual loss in patients with macula-on retinal detachment after vitrectomy and silicone oil injection. is could happen either during silicone oil tamponade [4, 21, 22] or at time of silicone removal [6, 7, 21, 23, 24] . is did not occur in our study and on the contrary vision improved in both groups.\n\n Our study differed from the aforementioned case series, especially with regard to the study design and included patients. Most of them were retrospective in nature, and their cases were macula-on rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Our study was prospective and all patients had detached maculae prior to vitrectomy. Moreover, the visual loss described in these series was found to be permanent in most patients, while visual acuity and retinal sensitivity in our study improved in all cases. Electrophysiological studies in these patients did not show consistent changes; however, some evidence of damage to ganglion and bipolar cells in macular area was found [4, 7, 10] . Based on these findings, macular dysfunction is proposed as the most likely cause of silicone oil related visual loss. In 2018, Scheerlinck et al. proposed that cases with silicone oil related visual loss and macula-off RRD may go unnoticed because their poor vision is already explained by a detached macula. However, against their theory, they did not find any differences in retinal sensitivity between macula-on and macula-off RRD in their study [12] .\n\n However, Scheerlinck and colleagues tested retinal sensitivity, using microperimetry, in 10 out of 20 patients who experienced unexplained visual loss following vitrectomy and silicone oil injection for macula-on detachment (but not preoperatively). A severely reduced central sensitivity on microperimetry was detected in these patients. is central scotoma differed in patients of retinal detachment with macular involvement, whose retinal sensitivity was reduced at all stimuli, as detected in our patients [10] , as shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) .\n\n Macular dysfunction after the use of silicone oil, in patients with unexplained visual loss after vitrectomy for macula-on detachment, has been supported by changes on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Patients showed microcystic edema in the inner nuclear layer and thinning of inner retinal layers [10, 21, 23] . In contrast, a more recent study demonstrated that silicone oil caused significant thinning of each retinal layer, not only the inner retinal layers [11] .\n\n Likewise, patients with detached maculae showed central foveal atrophy or thickening after pars planavitrectomy and silicone oil injection [25, 26] . Unfortunately, we have not included OCT in our study, which would have allowed the correlation between functional and structural evaluation of macula.\n\n e main strength of this study is that it is the first to use microperimetry to compare retinal sensitivity in the same patients prior to and after silicone oil removal. Since all secondary complications were excluded, we can conclude that the improvement was most likely related to the removal of the silicone oil. However, one of the limitations of our study was the small number of patients in each group in order to yield a statistically significant result.\n\n In conclusion, with the use of microperimetry, we noticed significant improvement of retinal sensitivity following silicone oil removal. However, the pathogenesis of silicone oil toxicity remains unclear.\n\n Larger prospective studies are required for better understanding the potential toxic effect of silicone oil on the retina and determining the proper timing of silicone oil removal. Longer postoperative follow-up may allow us to determine the degree of recovery from silicone oil toxicity.\n\n ese studies should combine both functional and structural evaluation of macula. Microperimetry will remain a valuable diagnostic tool in such studies.\n\n All the data used and/or analysed during the current study are available and can be presented by the corresponding author upon a reasonable request.\n\n is article has been presented in the Euretina Congress 2017 in Barcelona as an abstract.\n\n e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article. image. e test points were arranged within the macula showing the sensitivity values in 3 concentric circles centered on the fovea (a) with a preoperative mean retinal sensitivity of (4 dB) and (b) with a postoperative mean retinal sensitivity of (9.6 dB).", "qa": [["67_145983771_2_1", "What are some potential complications of silicone oil use in retinal detachment surgery?\n", "Some potential complications of silicone oil use in retinal detachment surgery include cataracts, silicone emulsification, and secondary glaucoma.

Radiotherapy is an accepted alternative to surgery in early stage disease, especially in the elderly and multimorbid patients with pulmonary dysfunction, because of significant morbidity and postoperative functional problems after classic partial supraglottic laryngectomy. Alonso [1] described horizontal supraglottic partial resection in 1947 and Vaughan [2] was the first to describe the use of the CO 2 laser resection of supraglottic carcinomas in 1978, mainly as staging procedure. The first steps in the treatment of benign lesions and the early stages of malignant supraglottic lesions were discussed by Davis et al. [3] in 1983. This first series of 20 patients was followed by series of selected cases reported by Zeitels et al. [4] in 1990 and Davis et al. [5] in 1991. Steiner commenced transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for carcinomas of the larynx in 1979. Since the early eighties he expanded the indications to all tumor categories of the upper aero-digestive tract [6] [7] [8] [9] . Within the last 20 years, glottispreserving TLM has gained importance in the surgical treatment of supraglottic carcinoma. At initial consideration, TLM seems to contradict classic rules of oncological surgery because tumors are divided and removed in several pieces [6, 10] . However, the hemostatic effect of the laser seals tissues, e.g., lymphatic microvessels without a higher risk of tumor spread compared with open approach [11] . Furthermore, due to the specific cutting properties of the CO 2 laser a differentiation between healthy tissue and tumor is possible under the operating microscope by cutting through the tumor [10] ; therefore, more healthy functional important structures can be preserved. TLM has several further advantages over conventional supraglottic laryngectomy, including avoidance of tracheotomy in most cases, faster and better recovery of swallowing function, lower incidences of aspiration or pneumonia, no pharyngocutaneous fistulae, shorter time of surgery, and shorter period of hospitalization.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of TLM in the treatment of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma and to compare its oncological and functional results with those of open surgery and radio(chemo-)therapy. For this reason local control, organ preservation rate, stage related survival, regional and distant metastatic spread, and functional outcome were analyzed. In addition to primary site tumor resection, patients were optionally treated by unilateral or bilateral neck dissection (mainly selective neck dissection), and postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy, depending on tumor stage (mainly for advanced neck disease).\n\n \n\n Between June 1980 and December 2006, a total of 277 previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx (T1-4, N0-2, M0) were treated with curative intent at the Departments for Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University of Erlangen (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) , surgery by the senior author) and G\u00f6ttingen (8/1986-12/2006 , surgery by 7 surgeons). Since 1986, a prospective database has been maintained of all patients undergoing TLM at the University of G\u00f6ttingen Medical Center. Of these patients, 46 were females (16 %) and 231 were males (84 %) with a median age of 59 years (range 26-89 years).

This upregulation might be caused by lost connection between primary afferent neurons and target tissues. Disruption of axonal transport of neuronal trophic factors synthesized by peripheral target tissues removes the restrictive effect on Gal expression [39, 40] . These remarkable changes coincide with the finding that Gal acts as an important antinociceptive factor and neuronal trophic factor for injured neurons [41] . All the above researches indicate that Gal upregulation after peripheral nerve injury could be considered as a transform of normal neuronal sensory conduction state to a protection and regeneration one.\n\n It has been demonstrated that nerve injury induces complex plasticity of Gal, GalR1 and GalR2 expression in DRG and SDH neurons, which play crucial role in neuropathic pain and nerve regeneration [26, 41] . In the present study, intrathecal injection of exogenous Gal caused a significantly downregulation of endogenous Gal in DRG. This change might be compensatory effect of exogenous Gal. Besides the dramatically change and important role of Gal after nerve injury, another very interesting question is whether and how Gal receptors change in this condition. In the present study, GalR1 expression was downregulated in DRG but The protein level was expressed as the ratio of control. The data are presented as mean 6 SD (n = 7). *P,0.05, **P,0.01, ***P,0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037621.g005 upregulated in SDH, whereas GalR2 was upregulated in both DRG and SDH after sciatic nerve-pinch injury at the same experimental time point. Intrathecal injection of exogenous Gal decreased GalR1 levels but did not influence GalR2 expression, which coincide with our previous study in vitro [42] . The effect of depression of GalR1 by exogenous Gal may be an activator/ receptor negative feedback just like the others receptor adaptive reaction. GalR1 has been confirmed to predominately locate in postsynaptic membrane [43] . Except inhibition of active neuropeptide release, activation of GalR1 may also reduce excitability of glutamatergic interneurons in SDH, thus cause antinociception [44] . The upregulation GalR1 in SDH makes this effect more potent after nerve injury, which may emphasize the important role of Gal in pain modulation in spinal level. In contrast to GalR1, which only couple to Gi protein, GalR2 can also activate Gq/11 protein leading to more complex functions [45] . Many studies pay close attention to neuroprotective and neuronal trophic effect of Gal conducted by GalR2 [46, 47] . In the present study, the GalR2 in DRG and SDH was upregulated, which makes the increasing Gal acts as neurotrophin more effective. An increasing and a relative independent expression of GalR2 in both DRG and SDH seem to be protected mechanisms, considerated its important role in nerve regeneration after nerve injury. Although it has been reported that GalR2 reduce its mRNA after axotomy [48] , this difference may explain by the different model used here. Sciatic nerve axotomy is a severe damage, and even caused DRG neuronal death [49] , but which can't be found in nerve-pinched animal model.\n\n In the present study, neuronal trophic actions and nerve regeneration function of exogenous Gal were investigated by observation of MNCV, SNCV, toluidine blue staining and ultrastructural alterations after nerve-pinch injury. The recovery of NCV is responding to regeneration of motor and sensory fibers. Intrathecal injection of exogenous Gal significantly accelerated the functional recovery of limb as measured by MNCV and SNCV. The toluidine blue staining and TEM analysis showed more Figure 6 .

The internal structure of the nerve was severely disorganized, sometimes with apparently enlarged nerve fibers (arrows) in Panel A1 or A2. Panel B1 and B2: The dystrophy appearance improved at day 8 and 16, respectively, after sciatic nerve-pinch injury with Gal treatment as compared with that in Panel A1 and A2. Panel B3: Most of the nerve fibers recovered to almost normal status at day 24 after sciatic nerve-pinch injury with Gal treatment. Panel C1, C2, and C3: Normal appearance of the sciatic nerve, with small and large diameter myelinated fibers regularly distributed in sham-operated control animals at day 8, 16 and day 24, respectively, after sham operation.

These morphological results further confirmed the tonic trophic effect of exogenous Gal after nerve injury.\n\n In conclusion, Gal, via acivition of GalR1 and/or GalR2, may have neuoprotective effects in reducing neuropathic pain behaviors and improving nerve regeneration after nerve injury. These findings imply that interference with Gal and its recepotr system might be effective for neuropathic pain treatment. These data offer a new point of view on the treatment of neuropathic pain as well as the neuroprotective effects of Gal and its receptor signaling system.", "qa": [["80_12011363_6_1", "How does Gal upregulation after peripheral nerve injury contribute to protection and regeneration?\n", "Gal upregulation after peripheral nerve injury can be considered a transformation from normal neuronal sensory conduction to a state of protection and regeneration.

Intrathecal injection of exogenous Gal decreases GalR1 levels but does not influence GalR2 expression.

There is some urgency for TB control as drug resistance increases and populations become more mobile -TB becomes more difficult to treat while effectively infecting the world's poorest communities no matter where they live. Consequently, WHO estimates that the reduction in global incidence must accelerate from the current 2 % per year [2] to meet new targets, and advocates strong social protection in addition to universal health care [3] . The marked heterogeneity in TB risk makes its dynamics particularly responsive to synergistic policies, such as targeted social measures or targeted HIV treatment to reduce variation, combined with TB interventions targeting the whole population to reduce disease. Adding to previous studies, which have assessed targeting control at the poor [4] or implementing population-wide measures with fixed stratification of disease risk [5] , here we examine how the impact of universal coverage interventions, such as a hypothetical vaccine against TB, depends on the underlying risk distribution in a population. Universal coverage interventions have greater impact on disease in populations where all individuals face similar risks, indicating that reducing inequality empowers existing disease control tools.\n\n In tuberculosis, it is well known that some groups have much higher risk to acquire infection and develop disease than the majority of the population: incarcerated prisoners (20 times higher in Brazil [6] ), persons living with HIV (8 times higher in a South African community [7] ), geographical hotspots within urban settings (3 times higher in people living in the poorest areas in Rio de Janeiro [8] ), among others. Behind these differences are differences in basic parameters, which measure how frequently each person is likely to meet an infectious case of TB and become infected, as determined by the way social mixing patterns combine with individual vulnerabilities [4] . These effective contact rates are then averaged and scaled into the so-called basic reproduction number, R 0 , defined as the average number of secondary disease cases caused by an average infectious person in a totally susceptible population. Similarly, the incidence of TB in the population is usually presented as a single number, which implicitly represents a weighted average of the incidences in groups of different sizes and relative risks. All this averaging would be fine if disease probabilities were linearly related with exposure intensity, but incidence describes a non-linear relationship with R 0 (Fig. 1) . This relation has a concave form due to the stronger depletion of susceptible hosts at higher transmission intensities. As a result, averaging incidences leads to underestimated R 0 and overoptimistic control expectations at the population level as recently demonstrated by a theoretical study applicable to infectious diseases more generally [9] .\n\n To illustrate the idea, we use a transmission model for TB, developed previously [10] and replicated in the appendix. In Fig. 1a , b incidence data for different countries are shown in a colour scheme defined by WHO region [2] , superimposed on how rates of TB incidence relate to R 0 according to two realisations of the model: a homogenous assumption, where all individuals experience the same rates of infection, disease progression and transmission (Fig. 1a) ; and a heterogeneous implementation where 4 % of individuals have a higher risk to contract the infection and infect others [8, 10, 11] (Fig. 1b) . All parameters satisfy the same mean values across the two model realisations, allowing comparison and demonstrating how heterogeneity in risk has a striking ability to modify the correspondence between incidence and R 0 . More specifically, to a given incidence, the heterogeneous model associates a reproduction number that is higher than that given by the corresponding homogeneous counterpart, resulting in greater resilience to universal coverage control efforts.\n\n For intuition, consider a population with some distribution of TB risk. The first people to be infected are those with higher risk, leaving behind a susceptibility pool with an average risk that decreases over time, by a process of cohort selection [12, 13] , until the system reaches equilibrium. Thus cohort selection acts effectively to suppress disease incidence, the more so the higher the transmission intensity. Now suppose that TB transmission is formulated into a model that collapses the risk distribution into its mean value. Cohort selection no longer occurs because all individuals in this model have the same risk, and therefore the system sustains a higher disease incidence by the time it reaches equilibrium. It follows that when two populations present the same overall disease incidence, we should expect a higher average risk where inequality is higher, but this is not revealed in overall disease incidence. Interestingly, any universal coverage intervention that reduces (directly) transmission potential also reduces (indirectly) the suppression imposed by cohort selection, and this effect is greater where inequality is higher.", "qa": [["72_15494935_0_1", "How does the World Health Organization plan to reduce the incidence rate of tuberculosis?\n", "The World Health Organization has set a target to reduce the incidence rate of tuberculosis by 90% in 20 years through their End TB Strategy.

The relationship between incidence and R0 is non-linear, with a concave form due to the depletion of susceptible hosts at higher transmission intensities. When there is heterogeneity in risk, the corresponding R0 is higher for a given incidence compared to a homogeneous assumption where all individuals have the same risk. This means that universal coverage control efforts may face greater resilience in populations with higher levels of inequality."]]}]
