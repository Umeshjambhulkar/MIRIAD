It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required.

It provides necessary information on the level of bone marrow involvement by plasma cells and its morphological specificities [2] . Minor and major criteria for the diagnosis according to the definition of the WHO classification include different categories of the bone marrow plasma cell count: a shift from 10%-30% group to >30% group equals shift from minor to major criteria, while <10% group does not contribute to the diagnosis [3] . In addition, plasma cell quantification is used in the evaluation of morphological remission [4] and minimal residual disease in MM patients [5] . A high percentage of plasma cells infiltration in bone marrow have been also recognized as a reliable predictor of relapse in cases of treated MM, as well as plasma cell microaggregates detected by immunohistology [6] . Plasma cell fraction in the bone marrow is therefore critical for the classification and optimal clinical management of patients with plasma cell dyscrasias.\n\n Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is essential for appropriate evaluation of plasma cell differentiation. On the basis of plasma cell morphology in BMA, myelomas can be classified into mature, intermediary, immature and plasmablastic [7] . It has been demonstrated that this division correlates with patient survival, since those with plasmablastic morphology have median survival of 10 months versus 35 months for all other types among which no significant difference in survival was observed [7, 8] . In comparison with BMA, trephine bone marrow biopsy (BMB) is not most suitable for the analysis of atypical plasma cells because of very difficult morphology identification of plasmablastic, lymphoid, lobated nucleus and polymorphic plasma cells.\n\n On the other hand, plasma cell infiltrates in bone marrow with increased reticulum fibers that can be observed in nearly 9% of MM are preferably estimated in BMB rather than BMA because reticuloplasia often leads to scanty cellular aspirates. In addition, studies have shown BMB to enable plasma cell infiltrate classification into interstitial, nodular and diffuse types [9, 10] . The amount of bone infiltrate varies from small clusters in otherwise normocellular bone marrow up to diffuse 100% bone marrow infiltration. The type of infiltration pattern is in proportion with the stage of disease. The interstitial and nodular patterns are observed when hematopoiesis is still preserved. In contrast, diffuse infiltration results in suppression of hematopoiesis. Transformation from interstitial or nodular towards diffuse infiltrate is observed as the disease progresses.\n\n Since accurate quantification of bone marrow plasma cells is an important step in the diagnosis and post-treatment assessment of plasma cell dyscrasias, the aim of the present study was to contribute to the current view of the importance of evaluating both BMA and BMB. At the same time, the value of image analyses in the diagnostic work-up remains to be determined. Thus, another objective of the study was to compare the plasma cell percentage estimated in BMA and in CD138 stained BMB evaluated microscopically or by computer-assisted digital image analysis (CIA), and then to compare these values with the patient clinical parameters, therapy response and survival. Treatment regimens were heterogeneous but in most cases included VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) infusion chemotherapy, melphalan and prednisolone, thalidomide alone or with dexamethasone, highdose dexamethasone, and bortezomib alone or with dexamethasone. Some patients were treated with high-dose medicamentous therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. All patients with bone disease were administered bisphosphonates and some of them also received local radiotherapy.\n\n Therapeutic response was defined according to the EBMT, IBMTR/ABMTR criteria [12] ; however, due to the small number of cases in some response groups, the patients were divided into two groups: those without any response or with refractory/progressive disease and those that achieved some response (complete, partial or minimal) to therapy.", "qa": [["13_4947994_0_1", "What are the different categories of bone marrow plasma cell count used in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma?\n", "The different categories of bone marrow plasma cell count used in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma include a shift from the 10%-30% group to the >30% group, which equals a shift from minor to major criteria.

Only 22 cases of aneurysm of the radial artery have been reported in the literature till 2006. [1] In PubMed research, there were about nine cases of iatrogenic radial PA reported between 2006 and 2016. The vast majority of cases are due to iatrogenic arterial lesions and their incidence has been increasing because of the higher use of interventional radiological procedures. The reported complications include catheter-related sepsis, thrombosis, peripheral embolization, and PA. PA is caused by disruption of the arterial wall at site of cannulation.\n\n A 26-year-old male patient was suffering from chronic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis twice a week for 6 months. The patient came to the institute for workup of cadaveric renal transplantation before 2 months. His right radial artery was punctured for ABG analysis in ward as a routine workup for sending a patient to dialysis. Special BD 2cc (heparinized) ABG syringe with 23-gauge needle was used for puncture of radial artery. Only one puncture was attempted for collecting the sample. First year resident of Anesthesia Department with experience of about 6 months punctured the radial artery. Compression of about 5 min with bandage was given over the punctured site.

On ultrasonography, swelling appeared to be cystic in nature measuring about 14 mm \u00d7 9 mm in size, communicating with the right radial artery at wrist joint. On color Doppler imaging, it had typical swirling pattern of flow [ Figure 2 ]. Spectral Doppler imaging revealed a classic to and fro waveform confirmed the diagnosis of PA [ Figure 3 ]. There was no evidence of thrombosis within PA, in radial artery or arteries of the right upper limb. Due to smaller size and asymptomatic nature of PA, the patient was not offered any treatment and close follow-up is advised. Size and patency of PA were checked every time, it did not seem to increase in size. The patient was discharged from our institute after completion of his cadaveric transplantation work-up. On follow-up Doppler study, it appeared to be thrombosed after 1 month.\n\n Trauma to the artery may lead to occlusion of the vessel by thrombosis, arteriovenous fistula formation or PA development. PAs are usually caused by trauma to the artery which leads formation of hematoma between the arterial wall and surrounding parenchyma. Continuous arterial blood creates a cavity which remains in continuity with the normal vessel, which is lined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. This false sac's inner wall is lined with endothelium, and the outer walls are formed of fibrous scar tissue. In contrast to a true aneurysm, which involves dilatation of all layers of the arterial wall, a PA is a false sac, being enclosed without the arterial wall.\n\n The main risk factors for formation of PA are shown in Table 1 .\n\n [2] Ranganath and Hanumanthaiah described that the site of arterial cannulation placement, timing, and number of catheter site changes made no significant difference in terms of complications.

The FDA recommended dosage for the IBS-C population is limited to 8 \u00b5g BID. There are no known drug-drug interactions identified to date.\n\n A study evaluating lubiprostone 24 \u00b5g BID to placebo for a period of 4 weeks in 237 subjects (119/118) with chronic constipation showed that the most common adverse events were nausea (21%), abdominal pain (6.7%) and dyspnea (3.4%). A total of 15 lubiprostone-treated subjects (12.6%) and 1 placebo subject (0.8%) discontinued treatment early. Among the lubiprostone subjects who discontinued early, the most common adverse events were nausea 2.5% (6/15) and abdominal pain 1.3% (3/15). There were no serious adverse events associated with the drug and no subject deaths during the study, furthermore, no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values, vital signs or physical examination findings were noted. 23 Johanson et al had assessed the long term safety and efficacy of lubiprostone in IBS-C. Subjects who demonstrated more than 70% compliance with the medication in the phase 3 studies were enrolled in the study. Lubiprostone was effective and well tolerated in adults with IBS-C throughout 48 weeks of treatment. The side effect profile in the placebo controlled and long term open studies were similar. The incidence of treatment related serious adverse events (1% in each group) and adverse events (22% vs. 21%) compared to placebo were similar. The only serious adverse event reported was non-cardiac chest pain which resolved with discontinuation of the medicine. The most common adverse events compared to placebo were nausea (8% vs. 4%), diarrhea (6% vs. 4%), and abdominal pain (4% vs. 5%) 19, 21 (Table 4) . Dyspnea has been reported in a few studies, with a prevalence of 0.4%. Although rare, this side effect typically occurred within an hour of the first dose, lasted no more than a few hours and often recurred with further use. When dyspnea occurred, subjects described as chest tightness and difficulty breathing. Dyspnea was generally self-limited and not considered as serious adverse event. 24 It remains unclear as to how lubiprostone causes dyspnea. In vitro studies have demonstrated that lubiprostone can activate chloride secretion when applied topically on respiratory epithelial tissue. 25 Until better understanding of the underlying mechanism, lubiprostone should be discontinued in subjects who develop dyspnea.\n\n Lubiprostone is classified as pregnancy category C, ie, animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in humans. Women of childbearing age should have a negative pregnancy test prior to initiating therapy. Its use during pregnancy can only be justified if the benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. 23 It is not clear whether lubiprostone is excreted in human milk.\n\n Lubiprostone at a dose of 8 \u00b5g BID is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of women age 18 and above with IBS-C. Several studies have validated its efficacy and its use has consistently been associated with favorable outcomes. The majority of subjects in all studies were females. Based on long term studies lubiprostone is safe and generally well tolerated, and has not been associated with any life threatening events. Pregnant women or those contemplating pregnancy should not take lubiprostone. Drug safety has been evaluated for a period of up to 13 months, and currently there are no limitations on duration of treatment, however, the indication should frequently be reassessed. The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, bloating and dizziness. Lubiprostone is currently an excellent treatment option for IBS-C.

Steroids are known to be the best medicine used in treating acute inflammation, but have side effects when used for long periods of time, such as lowering the resistance of infection. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also used to treat inflammation, but they bring about side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding [2] .\n\n Over-activation of the inflammatory mediators may contribute to gastric and intestinal mucosal damage [3] . Inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can affect the functioning of the mucosal barrier, thereby influencing its protective activity. Drug-induced damage to the GI tract has become a global problem due to widespread as well as the indiscriminate use of NSAIDs. Therefore, effective management of GI ulceration would primarily depend on the reduction of the aggressive factors, improved generation of protective factors or a combination of both. Advances in natural product chemistry have led to the purification and characterization of a number of chemical compounds with potent anti-ulcer activity [4] .\n\n Physalis minima L (Indonesian name as ciplukan) is wild vegetation found in the garden or wetland. This herb is commonly known as the bladder cherry and belongs to the Solanaceae family [5] . P.minima is an annual herb found throughout India, Baluchistan and Afghanistan, Tropical Africa and Australia, and is reported as one of the important medicinal plants in an Indian traditional system of medicine. The plant majorly contains phenols, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids [6] . Steroids of P.minima are physalin, resin, alkaloids, saponin and sterol. It contains also fatty acid. Several steroid compounds were found in the leaves of this plant, such as 13,14-seco-16,24-cyclosteroid consisted of physalin B, 5, 6\u03b2-epoxyphysalin B, withaphysalin A, withaphysalin B, physalin D and physalin L [7] .\n\n Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acyl ester bond of phosphoglycerides, releasing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. One of the fatty acids that can be released from membrane stores by the activity of PLA2 is arachidonic acid, the critical precursor for biosynthesis of diverse eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. At least 15 human genes encode different PLA2 isoenzymes, including both secreted and cytosolic forms [8] . PLA2 is now generally considered playing a major role in various inflammatory diseases including Helicobacter pyloriassociated gastritis or duodenitis [9] . Damage to the gastrointestinal surface protection system and the breakdown of complex membrane lipids activate PLA2, a key enzyme in the production of inflammatory lipid mediator. High concentrations of PLA2 have been reported in gastric mucosa [10] .\n\n None of the previous studies mentioned above revealed the potential effects of Physalis minima L as an gastric anti-inflammatory agent or its ulcer formation potential. Therefore, this study will attempt to analyze the potential effects of P.minima to reduce PLA2 activity as a marker of gastric inflammation. Besides, this study also compared the potential side effect (ulcer formation) of P.minima with aspirin as a standard NSAID. The hypothesis of this study is that the methanolic extract of Physalis minima L (MEPM) can reduce inflammation in the gastric mucosa and have minimal side effects compared to NSAIDs.\n\n \n\n Methanolic extract was obtained in three steps, including drying, extraction, and evaporation. The drying process was done by cutting clean leaves and stem of Physalis minima L into small pieces, and then heated at 60-70\u00baC. The drying samples were then blended and filtered using a mesh at size 60. A hundred grams of powder were added to 900 ml methanol in a 1 l Erlenmeyer jar.

A previous study has indicated that expression of DCR-3 is notable in chronic liver disease (31) . However, the significance of expression of DCR-3 in myocardial cells in progression of coronary heart disease has not been reported in a previous study (32) . The present study investigated the molecular mechanism of DCR-3 in myocardial cells in the progression of coronary heart disease. Although previous reports have reported that plasma DCR-3 levels may indicate the severity of coronary heart disease (33), the potential mechanism mediated by DCR-3 has not been reported in myocardial cells. The present results demonstrated that DCR-3 is downregulated in patients with coronary heart disease and increasing DCR-3 expression can prevent inflammation and apoptosis in myocardial cells induced by coronary heart disease. DCR-3 also mediate anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis potential through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in myocardial cells in the progression of coronary heart disease induced by TGF-\u03b21. These findings may elucidate the function of DCR-3 in processes of apoptosis and inflammation for patients with coronary heart disease.\n\n Inflammation is one of the most common symptoms of patients with acute coronary heart disease and the marked inflammation during acute coronary syndrome contributes to later depression in a subset of patients (34) . Inflammatory response may be used as a prognostic indicator for borderline lesion coronary heart disease patients, who were treated with naoxintong (35) . In addition, El-Mesallamy et al (36) have indicated that inflammation is one of factors in the imitation of coronary heart disease. Myocardial tissue has a higher level of inflammatory factors and lymphocytes. However, a stable DCR-3 analogue can reduce FasL-induced murine pulmonary inflammation (37) . At the same time, DCR-3 may improve experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by directly counteracting local inflammation, suggesting that DCR-3 is the potential agent for treating human multiple sclerosis (38) . All of these reports suggest that DCR-3 is associated with inflammatory responses in patients with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, although previous data demonstrated that slightly elevated cTnS levels may not be a sensitive prognostic marker for the Chinese population (39), a number of studies have indicated that serum cTnT levels are also regarded as an indicator of myocardial injury in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients (40) (41) (42) . The present results demonstrated that DCR-3 increased serum levels of cTnT and cTn1 in mice with coronary heart disease and that DCR-3 can inhibit inflammation responses and expression levels of inflammatory responses in myocardial cells in mice with coronary heart disease.\n\n Apoptosis of myocardial cells is another crucial factor in initiating coronary heart disease (7). Considerable evidence has indicated that apoptosis has an important role in hepatocyte death in chronic liver disease (43) . Research also demonstrated that apoptosis of leukocytes acts as a disease marker of neutrophil-endotheliocyte interaction in patients with coronary heart disease (14). Liu et al (15) have previously investigated the expression levels of inflammatory and apoptosis factors in coronary stent implantation in coronary heart disease patients, and demonstrated that downregulation of inflammatory and apoptosis factors is beneficial to the recovery of coronary heart disease. DCR-3, as a pleiotropic immunomodulator for enhancing angiogenesis, has been observed to downregulate cell apoptosis by binding with its receptor of FasL and LIGHT, and subsequently improved survival of many types of cell, such as human IPF fibroblasts (44) and mouse lymphocytes (45) . Furthermore, DCR-3 also suppressed FasL-induced apoptosis via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation in various cancer cells (46) (47) (48) . Furthermore, a number of studies have reported DCR-3 function in lymphocytes and dendritic cells (45, 49) . The present study indicated that DCR-3 could inhibit apoptosis of myocardial cells in mice with coronary heart disease, which contributed to protect myocardial cells against injury in the process of coronary heart disease. Notably, injury-associated protein levels of cTnT and cTn \u0406 were markedly upregulated in myocardium by the treatment of DCR-3. These results suggest that inhibition of apoptosis is the essential function of DCR-3 for the treatment of coronary heart disease. However, the present study did not use a healthy or sham control to identify the role of DCR-3 for the treatment of coronary heart disease, which is a limitation of this research.\n\n The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is involved in the progression of myocardial infarction in the process of coronary heart disease (50). Hu et al (51) presented the protective effect of proanthocyanidins on anoxia-reoxygenation injury of myocardial cells and results have indicated that the PI3K/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 pathway mediates mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel to regulate oxidative stress. It has also been indicated that the PI3K/AKT pathway-regulated recruiting T cells could attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in a mice model (52) . In the present study, by investigating the association between DCR-3 and the PI3K/AKT signal pathway in myocardial cells in mice with coronary heart disease, it was observed that DCR-3 mediated the improvement of myocardial ischemia via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Notably, it also demonstrated that endogenous inhibition of PI3K expression by Si-PI3K abolished DCR-3-mediated anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in myocardial cells in mice with coronary heart disease.\n\n In conclusion, the present study investigated the efficacy of DCR-3 in the progression of coronary heart disease and the molecular mechanism of DCR-3-mediated anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in myocardial cells in mice with coronary heart disease.

Incorporation of the genomic data into surgical management and multimodality protocols is expected in the near future.\n\n Immune therapy with checkpoint inhibitors has made significant inroads in several human malignancies, particularly those with a high tumor mutational burden, including melanoma, lung cancer, and head and neck malignancies. In gastrointestinal malignancies, tumors with microsatellite instability carry a heavy burden of neoantigens, and immunotherapy is very successful in this setting. Tran et al used a whole-exomicsequencing-based approach to demonstrate that tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma contained CD4\u00fe T-helper 1 (TH1) cells that recognize a mutation in ERBB2-interacting protein. After adoptive transfer of TILs containing mutation-specific polyfunctional TH1 cells, the patient achieved prolonged partial response. Upon disease progression, the patient was retreated with mutation-reactive TH1 cells and again experienced tumor regression. 31 These results provide evidence that a CD4\u00fe Tcell response against a mutated antigen can lead to tumor regression. Identification of immunogenic epitopes in the mutations seen in cholangiocarcinoma will be key to success with checkpoint inhibitors. Schumacher et al demonstrated that IDH1 (R132 H), seen in 20% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cases, contains an immunogenic epitope suitable for mutation-specific vaccination. 32 Peptides from the mutated region induce a CD4\u00fe immune response that can potentially be exploited by mutation-specific anti-IDH1 (R132 H) vaccines. Programmed cell death receptor 1 (PDL1) expression has been reported in about 40% of cholangiocarcinoma cases, but mutational tumor burden is generally low. Further immunologic profiling of cholangiocarcinoma is required to identify susceptible cases for immune interventions. Recent results with pembrolizumab in pretreated biliary tract cancers having PDL1 expression indicated that 17% of patients have a meaningful response to checkpoint blockade.

(1986) in Florida grapefruit; Singh and Sudhakar Rao (2005) in papaya; Sudhakar Rao et al. (2000) and Dhall et al. (2012) in cucumber. The difference in prevention of weight loss by different films is attributed to the differences in their WVTR as mentioned earlier. Ladaniya et al. (1997) also recorded differences in weight loss of 'Nagpur' mandarin oranges shrink wrapped with different polymeric films of variable permeabilities. The lower weight loss in shrink wrapped fruits was also reflected by a lower loss in rind thickness and rind moisture content (Table 2) wrapped fruits at both the temperatures in both the cultivars.\n\n Red colour of the peel is an important visual quality factor for marketing of pomegranate. At harvest, the Hunter L* value (that indicates brightness) of the fruit were 38.63 and 49.33 for 'Mridula' and 'Bhagwa' cultivars, respectively. Similarly, the surface colour hue angle and chroma values respectively were 21.48 and 50.56 for 'Mridula' and 26.19 and 58.74 for 'Bhagwa' cultivar. These colour values indicate, 'Bhagwa' cultivar had more bright red peel colour than 'Mridula' and the same trend continued during one month of storage at ambient temperature irrespective of the packaging. Shrink wrapping had significant effect in the retention of brightness (L* values) of fruits in both cultivars compared to non-wrapped ones which became dull in appearance as indicated by lower L* values (Table 1) . Among different shrink films, fruits wrapped in D-955 and LDPE films had significantly higher L* values in both cultivars after 4 weeks of storage at ambient temperature. Beyond three weeks of storage fruits wrapped in BDF film, which is extremely ([ 1000 times) low permeable to both oxygen and carbon dioxide gases, had significantly lower L* values. There was a significant decrease in the h value of non-wrapped pomegranates of both cultivars during storage indicating reddening of peel colour. This could be attributed to the concentration of peel colour due to more moisture loss (as shown in Table 2a ) from the peel of nonwrapped fruits. By the end of 4 weeks storage, the peel moisture was reduced to 24.76 and 23.32 in 'Mridula' and 'Bhagwa' cultivars, respectively from the initial content of 77.17 and 78.0%. The lowest hue angle recorded in control fruits of 'Mridula' cultivar when compared to wax treated fruits after 60 days of storage resulted in non-desirable deep tan red colour with dull shining (Barman et al. 2011) . However the C* values which represent the intensity of colour decreased significantly in these fruits. In shrink wrapped fruits the original red colour of the peel retained to a greater extent in both varieties with slight increase in h values and slight decrease in C* values during the 4 weeks of storage at ambient temperature. Among different shrink films, the peel colour was maintained better (lower h value and higher C* values) when the fruits were wrapped with D-955 or LDPE film. Beyond three weeks of storage, fading of red peel colour was observed in the fruits wrapped with BDF film in both cultivars, with higher h value and lower C* values. This could be attributed to its low gas permeability to carbon-dioxide that might have caused some discolouration of surface peel colour.\n\n At 8\u00b0C also, shrink wrapping had significant effect on the retention of brightness (L* values) of fruits during 3 months storage in both cultivars compared to nonwrapped ones which became dull in appearance as indicated by lower L* values (Table 1b) .

Moreover, when Pasqualucci et al. (1994) assessed visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, they found that the local anesthetic infiltration group also exhibited significantly lower pain scores as well. Second, two prospective studies found that, compared with inhalational anesthesia, epidural anesthesia was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative infections, a biologically significant immune outcome (Cuschieri, Morran, Howie, & McArdle, 1985; Yeager, Glass, Neff, & Brinck-Johnsen, 1987) . Cuschieri et al. (1985) also documented significantly lower postoperative VAS pain scores in the epidural group. Third, narcotic anesthesia has been shown to suppress the hormonal response to surgery (Lacoumenta et al., 1987) . Fourth, effective postoperative pain management with systemic opioids has been associated with reductions in plasma cortisol levels (Moller, Dinesen, Sondergard, Knigge, & Kehlet, 1988) . Finally, it was recently shown that providing analgesic doses of morphine in rats significantly attenuates surgery-induced increases in the metastasis of a tumor cell line that is controlled by natural killer cells, providing further evidence of the potential negative immune consequences of pain with implications for the whole organism (Page, Ben-Eliyahu, & Liebeskind, 1994; Page, McDonald, & Ben-Eliyahu, in press ).\n\n The inflammatory response is an important mechanism to consider for its contributions to pain, immunity, and the initiation of wound healing. Tissue damage from surgical procedures causes the local release of factors including substance P, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and histamine. Cytokines such as IL-1 are released from indigenous tissue cells and early recruited cells, such as the neutrophil (Htibner et al., 1996) . Together, these factors initiate the inflammatory response marked by vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and the sensitization of peripheral afferent nerve fibers. In addition to its immune-related roles, IL-1 contributes to local hyperalgesia (Schweizer, Feige, Fontana, Muller, & Dinarello, 1988) , as well as a systemic hyperalgesic state and illness symptoms such as fever and malaise (Watkins et al., 1995) . The sensitization of nociceptive fibers manifests as a decrease in the threshold necessary to initiate nociceptive impulse transmission, resulting in hyperalgesia (Woolf, 1994) . Prostaglandin E participates in the local sensitization of nociceptive fibers (Martin, Basbaum, Kwiat, Goetzl, & Levine, 1987) , as well as in the suppression of NKCA (Leung, 1989) . Faist et al. (1990) showed that inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin treatment reversed surgery-induced depression of postop-erative delayed type hypersensitivity responses and lymphocyte proliferation and also resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of infection.\n\n It is clear that pain, like other stressors, adversely affects immune function; anesthetics that block transmission of nociceptive impulses are also associated with better immune function, as well as reductions in postoperative infections. As will be discussed shortly, more anxious patients experience greater postsurgical pain (Johnston, 1988) . Thus, more distressed individuals could ultimately be doubly disadvantaged: Immune function, already poorer as a consequence of presurgical stress, could decline even further as a consequence of enhanced postsurgical pain.\n\n Aging is associated with an increased risk for surgery. Immune function declines with age, particularly functional aspects of the cellular immune response (Verhoef, 1990) ; these age-related declines are related to infectious complications, one factor in the increased surgical mortality in the elderly (Thomas & Ritchie, 1995) . Moreover, age and distress appear to interact to promote immune down-regulation: Older adults show greater immunological impairments related to stress or depression than younger adults (Herbert & Cohen, 1993; .\n\n Some evidence suggests that surgical stress may also interact with both age and psychological stress to heighten risk for older adults.

Because of their ability to degrade ECM proteins, MMPs mediate tissue remodeling under physiological and pathological circumstances. The proteolytic activity of MMPs is counterbalanced by the presence of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which naturally inhibit MMPs by direct binding [6] . MMP-12, also called macrophage metalloelastase, was originally detected in alveolar macrophages of cigarette smokers [7] . It is secreted as a 54 kDa inactive pro-enzyme which is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the prodomain followed by processing into two active enzymes of 45 kDa and 22 kDa [7] . MMP-12 degrades a broad range of ECM proteins, including elastin, type IV collagen, fibronectin, laminin and gelatin [8, 9] , and is involved in turnover of the matrix, cell migration, tissue repairing and remodeling. In addition, MMP-12 can activate other MMPs, for example, MMP-2 and -3, leading to subsequent degradation of other ECM proteins [10] .\n\n MMP-12 may facilitate airway inflammation by stimulating migration of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and macrophages to inflammatory sites, and mediate airway remodeling by degrading ECM proteins through its enzymatic activity or through mediating inflammatory cytokines to induce other MMPs, including MMP-2, -9, -13 and -14, in lung [11] . Overproduction of MMP-12 causes pathological ECM protein breakdown and excessive airway remodeling, which has been implicated in a range of respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Causal relationship between low ionized calcium and the outcome, if any, includes the following issues. Hypocalcemia leads to heart failure 22, 23 and arrhythmia 24 . Moreover, in patients undergoing hemodialysis, hypocalcemia is more likely to be associated with a positive net balance of calcium during dialysis 19 . Positive calcium balance is a risk of myocardial infarction, especially in diabetic patients with low PTH 25 . This might be explained by exacerbation of vascular calcification. Another possibility is residual confounding by poor nutritional status, since patients with low ionized calcium tended to have older age, lower BMI, lower albumin levels, and diabetes. In fact, we adjusted for these covariates when studying the association between low ionized calcium levels and the outcome. However, malnutrition cannot be sufficiently explained only by these traditional markers.\n\n Prior studies reported the association between higher corrected calcium and poor prognosis 8, 9 . This association might be partly explained by overestimation of calcium status among patients with hypoalbuminemia, who are at high risk for mortality 26 . Since albumin is an important carrier for calcium 1 , uncorrected calcium levels are intrinsically dependent on serum albumin levels. In fact, in the aforementioned study 21 Table 3 . Associations of calcium status stratified by ionized and corrected calcium with the primary outcome in the final model. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using model 4 with normal corrected and ionized calcium group as reference. Low ionized calcium levels despite normal corrected calcium levels (hidden hypocalcemia) was a significant risk for the primary outcome, while low ionized calcium levels and low corrected calcium levels (apparent hypocalcemia) was not. Since there was only 1 patient with normal ionized and low corrected calcium, adjusted hazard ratio in this group is not shown. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ levels of 7.5 mg/dL or less were not high risk for mortality in hypoalbuminemic patients (less than 3.8 g/dL). In other words, serum albumin levels modify the association between uncorrected calcium and mortality.\n\n However, we should not forget that the equation of corrected calcium cannot be used to infer ionized calcium levels just before the dialysis initiation, when discussing the association between calcium status and prognosis. Although true hypocalcemia defined by low ionized calcium was a significant risk factor, hypocalcemia defined by low corrected calcium was not. Misclassifications of low calcium status possibly result in an overestimation of the prognosis. In other words, physicians may overlook the worse prognosis of patients with hidden hypocalcemia on the grounds of their normal corrected calcium levels.\n\n Notably, hidden hypocalcemia, and not apparent hypocalcemia, was associated with a higher likelihood of developing the primary outcome, although ionized calcium levels were much lower in the apparent hypocalcemia group than in the hidden hypocalcemia group. Patients with hidden hypocalcemia were more likely to have a history of diabetes, PCI/CABG, and heart failure than patients with apparent hypocalcemia. Additionally, patients with hidden hypocalcemia had higher serum bicarbonate levels (pH) than patients with other calcium statuses, suggesting lower protein intake in this population 27 . Low protein intake accelerates body weight loss 28 . In fact, patients with hidden hypocalcemia had lower BMI and serum albumin levels than patients with apparent hypocalcemia. Since, the definition of cachexia includes weight loss and low serum albumin 28 , patients with hidden hypocalcemia might have suffered from cachexia, which is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underling chronic illnesses such as CKD or chronic heart failure 28 . Patients with hidden hypocalcemia were likely to have abnormal high ALP despite a lower iPTH than patients with apparent hypocalcemia. High ALP levels relative to PTH is characteristic of osteomalacia 29 , possibly derived from vitamin D deficiency 30 . Weight loss and vitamin D deficiency, which suggest malnutrition, are risk factors for mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis [31] [32] [33] .

It can lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, and exacerbation of vascular calcification. Additionally, hypocalcemia is associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction, especially in diabetic patients with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

Patients with hypoalbuminemia, who are at high risk for mortality, may have an overestimation of calcium status due to the association between higher corrected calcium and poor prognosis. Serum albumin levels modify the association between uncorrected calcium and mortality. Hidden hypocalcemia, defined by low ionized calcium levels despite normal corrected calcium levels, is associated with a higher likelihood of developing adverse outcomes.

Exercise intensity. Six acute studies reported the effect of exercise intensity on post-exercise energy intake. Four studies found no effect of exercise intensity on absolute energy intake following exercise [51, 60, 64, 85] ; however, Imbeault et al. [51] reported a lower relative energy intake following high intensity exercise (75% VO 2 max) compared with low intensity exercise (35% VO 2 max) or non-exercise control. One study [52] showed a significant increase in absolute energy intake for high (70% VO 2 peak) but not low intensity exercise (40% VO 2 peak); however relative energy intake was lower in both the high and low intensity exercise groups compared with non-exercise controls. One study reported a significant decrease in absolute energy intake following strenuous (40 min/90 W cycle ergometer) but not moderate exercise (40 min/30 W cycle ergometer) in non-obese but not in obese women [75] .\n\n Exercise duration. Two studies evaluated the role of exercise duration on post-exercise energy intake with divergent results. King et al. [60] reported no effect of exercise duration on post-exercise energy intake; however, Erdman et al. [64] reported that absolute energy intake was not significantly greater than control following cycle ergometer exercise bouts of 30 and 60 min, but was significantly greater than control following 120 minutes of exercise.\n\n Exercise time of day. Two studies evaluated the effect of the time of day of aerobic exercise on post-exercise energy intake [55, 63] . Both studies found no significant difference in absolute post-exercise energy intake between exercise performed in the morning (7 and 8:15 AM) compared to the same exercise performed in the evening (5 and 7:15 PM). However, O'Donoghue et al. [55] showed that relative energy intake at breakfast was lower after morning exercise compared with afternoon exercise or control while relative energy intake at dinner was lower post afternoon exercise compared with control.\n\n Composition of test meals. Four studies evaluated the effect of the macronutrient composition of the test meal on postexercise energy intake. Three studies found no significant differences in absolute post-exercise energy intake compared to rest between low or high fat test meals [70, 71, 74] . King et al. [59] found no difference in absolute post-exercise energy intake when either high fat/low carbohydrate or low fat/high carbohydrate test meals were presented; however, relative energy intake was significantly lower in the low fat/high carbohydrate, but not the high fat/low carbohydrate condition compared with control.\n\n Time between the end of exercise and the presentation of the test meal. In the one acute study that investigated the effect of time between exercise and presentation of the test meal on energy intake, Verger et al. [67] showed that absolute energy intake increased as the time post-exercise that the test meals were presented increased (immediate to 120 min).\n\n Age. No studies evaluated the effect of age on post-exercise energy intake. Studies were generally conducted in young adults with a median age of 23 years.\n\n Gender. Although 6 studies included both men and women [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] the data were presented separately in only one study. Verger et al.

Three studies provided data on the effect of weight status on post-exercise energy intake [73, 75, 86] . George et al. [73] found non-significant differences in absolute post-exercise energy intake between normal and overweight women. Kissileff et al.

This combination also induces c e l l c y c l e a r r e s t a t G 0 / G 1 p h a s e ; h o w e v e r , i t s u ppresses apoptosis compared to vitamin K 2 alone (48). Carnosic acid, a plant-derived polyphenolic antioxidant, enhances the monocytic differentiation effects of calcitriol in human myeloid leukemia cells HL60 (49). Decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species, increased intracellular glutathione, and activation of Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway are observed with the combination treatment (49). Bryostatin-1, a marine bryozoan-derived natural compound, has antitumor activities in both solid and lymphoid tumors (50). Bryostatin-1 synergizes with calcitriol to induce monocytic differentiation of NB4 cells (50, 51), which is associated with G1 phase cell cycle arrest, decreased cell growth and increased plastic adhesion (50). 25(OH)D 3 , when used together with iron deprivation agents including iron chelators or transferrin receptor antibody A24, induces the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary myeloblasts from AML patients into monocytes/macrophages (52). These effects are dependent on the increased level of reactive oxygen species and the activation of JNK MAPK pathway (52).\n\n Interaction of calcitriol with certain agents results in enhanced calcitriol anti-tumor activity. Administration of dexamethasone (Dex), which reduces calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia, prior to calcitriol inhibits SCC cell proliferation compared to calcitriol alone (53)\n\n The effect of calcitriol is modulated by its metabolizing enzymes. The primary vitamin D 3 inactivating enzyme CYP24A1, a mitochondrial cytochrome P450, induces calcitriol degradation and thereby inhibits calcitriol biological activity. The broad spectrum cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole (KTZ) or a specific CYP24A1 inhibitor RC2204, which effectively inhibits the expression and enzyme activity of CYP24A1 in PC3 cells and mice kidney tissue, synergistically inhibits the anti-proliferative effect of calcitriol in human prostate PC3 cells (55). Dex is administered together with KTZ to minimize calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia. Enhanced apoptosis is observed which does not involve caspase 3 activation but the translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus. Calcitriol and ketoconazle/Dex combination enhances the growth inhibition observed with calcitriol alone in PC3 xenograft tumor mouse model (55). KTZ also potentiates the anti-proliferative effect of calcitriol or its analog EB1089 in prostate cancer cells (56). An imidazole derivative liarozole inhibits CYP24 activity in prostate cancer cells DU145 and thus sensitizes these cells to calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition, which is associated with increased VDR expression (57).\n\n RRR-alpha-vitamin E succinate (VES), one of the most effective vitamin E forms, induces VDR expression in prostate cancer cells (58) . Pretreatment with VES synergistically enhances calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells in vitro and r e d u c e s t h e r a t e o f p r o s t a t e c a n c e r x e n o g r a f t t u m o r growth (58) , which allows for a low-dose calcitriol to be administered. A glutathione-depleting compound, menadione, sensitizes breast cancer cells MCF-7 to calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition, which may be caused, at least in part, by the increased oxidative stress, as shown by enhanced ROS production (59).\n\n Genistein, an isoflavone found in soybeans and a number of plants, in combination with calcitriol, inh i b i t s c e l l g r o w t h i n h u m a n p r o s t a t e L N C a P c e l l s , which is dependent on increased expression of p21 and associated with increased VDR expression (60) .", "qa": [["16_7873035_3_1", "How does the combination of calcitriol analog and vitamin K2 affect leukemia cells?\n", "The combination of a calcitriol analog and vitamin K2 promotes the differentiation of leukemia cells into monocytes.
