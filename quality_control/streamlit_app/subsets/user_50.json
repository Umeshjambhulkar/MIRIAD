Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

The latter interpretation seems the more likely: (i) because the patients would be expected to be sensitized during the course of active disease and subsequent immunotherapy with AML cells; (ii) because, occasionally, remission lymphocytes respond to autologous AML cells when they do not respond to allogeneic lymphocytes (e.g. response of patient 9 weeks after chemotherapy, Fig. 1 ).

Subsequently, inhibition of neoangiogenesis could arrest or halt tumor progression, and would therefore provide an important strategy for anti-cancer therapy [37] . Here, we showed that IL-17F was able to inhibit HUVEC tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings support previous observations where the IL-17F-driven inhibition was interpreted as an outcome of inducing the transforming growth factor pathway [38] . In the same line, reductions of angiogenesis by IL-17F were reported in in vivo animal studies of hepatocellular and colon carcinomas [15, 17] . IL-17F downregulated important proangiogenic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor. This could lead to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis [17] .\n\n Cancers 2019, 11, 650 9 of 13 As IL-17A was reported to promote angiogenesis [39] , we compared our results of IL-17F with IL-17A. However, our data did not show any consistent effect of IL-17A on HUVEC tube formation. Such a difference between IL-17F and IL-17A could be explained by the different affinities to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC between these cytokines [24] .\n\n Based on the literature, the physiological level of IL-17F in healthy serum samples is 394.3 \u00b1 96.42 pg/mL, and this is reduced to 169.6 \u00b1 50.58 pg/mL in patients with oral cancer [18] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no data concerning IL-17F concentrations in tissue. We assume that it is higher than in serum since it is produced by stromal cells, such as MCs [13, 19] . Based on this assumption, we tested the effect of low-level (1 ng/mL) IL-17A and IL-17F on HUVEC cell angiogenesis. Even with this concentration, the results had the same trends as the higher test concentrations.\n\n There has been an increasingly growing interest over the past decades in harnessing cytokines for the treatment of cancer. Recently, cytokines have been an attractive target in cancer therapeutics research [11, 12] . Preclinical experiments with several murine cancer models showed very promising antitumor effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-21 [40] . Moreover, IL-2, for instance, has long been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer and melanoma [40] . Medications targeting IL-17A showed efficacy in psoriasis and arthritis, which implies that translating these in vitro findings into future clinical use is feasible [41] . The presented anticancer properties of IL-17F could pave the way for novel therapeutic targets in OTSCC patients.\n\n \n\n We used two different types of human OTSCC cell lines, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), primary human oral keratinocytes (HOKs), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). For the OTSCC cell lines, the highly-invasive HSC-3 cell line and the less-invasive SCC-25 cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-12 (Gibco, Paisley, UK).

Heritability of urate levels is estimated to be approximately 60% [51] . Typical of the situation for other complex phenotypes, the proportion of variance in urate levels explained by common genetic variants detected by GWAS is low (7.0%) [4] , accounting for only a small proportion of the genetic component. This problem has been termed the 'missing heritability' [52] , with the explanation(s) for this phenomenon unresolved.\n\n In GWAS data sets, calculations to estimate the contributions of SNPs to heritability use cross-sectional casecontrol data. These yield the 'narrow-sense' heritability (h 2 ), in which only the heritability from the average effect of genetic variants acting independently (additively) is estimated and contributions from epistasis and non-additive gene-environment (GxE) interactions are ignored. There are various theories to explain the missing heritability: (a) that common causal variants of weak effect go undetected in GWASs, (b) that undetected rare variants with larger effect sizes contribute, (c) that the heritability estimates of known genetic variants that are derived from the narrow-sense models are under-estimated owing to the unaccounted contribution of epistasis between loci, and (d) similarly that narrow-sense heritability estimates are under-estimated because of the unaccounted for contribution of non-additive GxE effects. In control of urate, there is evidence to support possibility (a); 27% to 41% (depending on the data set) of heritability is explained when all common SNPs and not just the statistically significant SNPs are considered [4] . It will be possible to address possibility (b) when all genetic variation can be evaluated from large whole-genome sequence data sets. Improvement in analytical approaches and computational power will allow testing of (c) from current GWAS data. Regarding (d), there is evidence that non-additive GxE interactions will explain an under-appreciated proportion of the missing heritability in urate. In addition to the SLC2A9-SSB interaction discussed previously [26] , there is non-additive interaction between alcohol exposure and the lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 gene (LRP2) (rs2544390) in the risk of gout in Polynesian populations, where the protective effect of the T-positive genotype is negated by exposure to alcohol [53] . Finally, a nonadditive interaction between diuretic use and genotype at each of SLC2A9 and SLC22A11 in the risk of gout in hypertensive people has been reported in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study [54] . These findings, subject to wider replication and support from interventional studies, also raise the possibility of personalized approaches to the management of hyperuricemia.\n\n As expected, most of the urate loci are also risk factors for gout [4, 12, 13] , with only four loci (INHBB, HNF4G, UBE2Q2, and BCAS3) yet to be formally associated with gout at a nominal level of significance. Use of larger gout case sample sets should enable this to be done. The urate-raising allele in Europeans is associated with increased risk of gout in the considerable majority of circumstances, including in Polynesians [12] . Exceptions to this are PRKAG2 and HLF where the European urateraising allele protects from gout in Polynesians [12] . This observation could be useful in fine-mapping the causal variant at each locus under the hypothesis that the associated SNPs (rs10480300 and rs7224610) are not causal and that there is a recombinant haplotype differentiating gout risk at these loci. The causal variant can be expected to map to surrounding DNA where the same allele of genetic variants would consistently associate with risk of gout in both ancestral groups.\n\n While correlation between increased effect size on urate and effect size on gout is seen [4] , it is logical to expect that genetic variants with a similar effect on serum urate should have a similar effect on the risk of gout. However, this is not necessarily the case. The risk alleles of GCKR, SLC16A9, SLC22A11, and INHBC are associated with an average increase in serum urate of 0.004 mmol/L [4] .", "qa": [["52_5235_7_1", "What is the heritability of urate levels and what factors contribute to the \"missing heritability\"?\n", "The heritability of urate levels is estimated to be approximately 60%.

Complex viruses (lentiviruses, spumaviruses, some oncoviruses) encode virion structural genes (gag, pol, and env) as well as regulatory genes (rev, rex, tat, tax, nif, vpu, etc).\n\n Looking from outside inwards, retroviruses have a phospholipid spherical bilayer containing protruding spikes of envelope glycoprotein. Matrix proteins connect the envelope to the capsid protein icosahedral shell. Within this capsid shell are reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase proteins and two positive sense RNA strands (positive strand RNA is translated to protein and is transcribed from negative strand DNA).\n\n Since simple retroviral vectors (oncovirinae) are currently the predominant vehicles for gene therapy trials, this discussion will exclude complex (lentiviruses, spumaviruses) retroviruses. Retroviral genomes are 7-10 kilobases in length. 46 They are composed of cis elements that are noncoding areas of the genome necessary for replication and trans elements which are coding elements that give rise to proteins ( Figure 2) . 47 In the Maloney murine leukemia virus, the retroviral cis elements are located in the termini of the viral genome. In general, these elements must be retained in a functional retroviral vector. Cis elements at the 5\u2032 end are termed R, U5, PB, and L. The repeat (R) sequence at each end of the genome is involved in transfer of the growing chain during reverse transcription. 48, 49 U5 is a unique sequence near the 5\u2032 end that forms stem loops required for initiation of reverse transcription. 50 PB is the primer binding site for transfer RNA (t-RNA). 51 All polymerases need a primer to initiate chain elongation. Reverse transcriptase uses t-RNA which binds to the PB site of the retrovirus. L represents the Leader region that is untranslated and contains the splice donor site (SD) for generation of spliced mRNA transcripts, and psi () the signal for packaging RNA into the virion. 52, 53 Cis elements at the 3\u2032 end are termed PP, U3 and R. The polypurine (PP) region is AG rich and is the primer for plus strand DNA synthesis during reverse transcription. U3 is a unique sequence at the 3\u2032 end that contains transcription enhancer/promotor motifs and transcription start signals which regulate transcription of the integrated provirus. 54, 55 Transcriptional control motifs in the U3 region influence the rate of viral transcription.\n\n Retroviral trans-elements are the protein coding sequences: gag (group-specific antigen), pol (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), and env (envelope glycoprotein). The gag protein is from the N terminal to C terminal end composed of matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. 56 The MA domain determines the site of viral assembly by targeting the protein to the plasma membrane. 57, 58 The NC domain of gag binds to the RNA packaging () motif of the retrovirus to incorporate the retroviral RNA genome within the virion. 59 The pol gene is composed of three enzymes, a protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase. 60 The gag-pol transcript is translated into one protein or two proteins, gag and pol, that arise from ribosomal frame shifting at the time of translation. The viral protease cleaves gag-pol at the time of viral budding into the MA, CA, NC, protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase proteins. Reverse transcriptase converts the RNA genome into proviral DNA. 61 Integrase forms an integration complex with proviral DNA to insert the provirus into cellular DNA. The envelope protein arises from a spliced transcript occurring between splice donor (SD) and splice acceptor (SA) sites. The envelope protein undergoes proteolysis by cellular proteases into surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins. 62 The SU protein determines receptor binding affinity and specificity of the virion.\n\n Retroviral virion binding occurs via envelope protein to a cellular receptor. Endocytosis of the receptor/virion com- plex, release of the viral core, and reverse transcription results in generation of double stranded DNA (provirus).", "qa": [["60_23513807_1_1", "What are the structural genes involved in virion formation in retroviruses?\n", "The structural genes involved in virion formation in retroviruses are gag, pol, and env.

The patient was not a surgical candidate (CHF, pacemaker, edema) and not diabetic. PAST MANAGEMENT: For 2 years, the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies in treating the wound including regular debridements and Regranex therapy for 6 weeks. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91, the patient developed osteomyelitis. Standard antibiotic therapies were inaugurated. CURRENT CLINICAL APPROACH: In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3 mL/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLO) as the patient ambulates. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3\u2033-x-4\u2033 island dressing.

HELLO PROSTHESIS Sharon Anderson, BSN, MA, MSCC, swedishone@msn.com, Kaiser Permanente, Sacramento, Calif BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum is an often-idiopathic ulcer with a characteristic appearance of an undermined necrotic blush edge and a peripheral erythematous halo. The current case deals with a 75-year-old female with a 4-year history of a nonhealing right leg ulcer with a biopsy diagnosis of PG, recalcitrant to medical management. The lesion progressed to a chronic underlying osteomyelitis. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the initiated management. METHOD: The patient was managed over 4 years with a wide spectrum of modalities, including topical debriding agents, Dakins dressing changes, vacuum-assisted closure, multiple silver agents, and Cyclosporin/Prednisone trials. The surrounding skin was severely atrophic due to the chronic steroid application. X-ray, nuclear studies and MRI studies demonstrated progression to bony involvement with osteomyelitis. The patient became despondent with the failed responses and continued pain and agreed to transtibial amputation. At 2-week follow-up the incisional wound demonstrated probable local PG recurrence. Wound care with enzymatic debridement, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) fiber dressing with ionic silver* was initiated a daily basis. RESULTS: Over a 2-month postoperative period the wound improved weekly with subsequent complete closure.

The girl developed nausea and vomiting shortly after the ingestion. At the ED, she was fully conscious. Her vital signs were normal, except tachypnea. Oxygen saturation was 90%. The other abnormal physical findings were stridor and severe oropharyngeal erythema. Chest x-ray image was normal. Her blood chemistry tests showed mild metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 13. Shortly after admission, she was intubated with an endotracheal tube in the operation room. She was diagnosed as having severe gastrointestinal injury from caustic ingestion. Conservative treatment was planned. Nothing per oral and total parenteral nutrition was implemented. On the first day of admission, she developed gross hematuria; a urinary catheter was then inserted without urinary irrigation. The first urinary analysis showed red blood cells (RBC) 50-100 per high power field (hpf) without dysmorphic RBC, blood 3+, protein 1+ and pH 5.5. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 28 and 0.43 mg/dL, respectively. Ultrasonographic study of both kidneys was unremarkable. The gross hematuria gradually subsided. Because fever was observed, intravenous antibiotic was administered.

However, her urine was clear since discharge.\n\n Report of this case was approved by the Committee on Human Rights Related to Research Involving Human Subjects, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University (MURA 2015/139). The mother of patient provided written informed consent for this publication.\n\n Acute kidney injury is reported as one of the systemic toxicities of acid ingestion [5] [6] [7] . However, hematuria was rarely described. It was found to be associated with patient mortality [7] [8] [9] . Nevertheless, these prior studies did not describe the investigation in detail or the suspected cause or the mechanism of the hematuria.\n\n In the present patient, the history and physical examination findings of formic acid ingestion were clear. Here, we have reported a case of self-limiting gross hematuria after ingesting formic acid, causing significant gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract injury. Investigational studies for establishing its cause were performed. No abnormality that might be the etiology of hematuria was found. From our observation, hematuria should not be caused by glomerular injury because there was no dysmorphic RBC found in her urine. The ultrasonography study suggested no anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract in this patient. However, because we did not perform a cystoscopic study of the urinary bladder, we could therefore not elucidate the probable pathophysiology of hematuria after acid ingestion. We confirm some previous studies and accent that hematuria could be a consequence of acid ingestion, although more studies are needed. In conclusion, significant hematuria could be a systemic effects from acid ingestion, but in this case it was self-limiting.", "qa": [["83_79300776_0_1", "What are the potential systemic toxicities associated with acid ingestion?\n", "Acid ingestion can lead to various systemic toxicities, including metabolic acidosis, hemolysis, hepatitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

Such a neural connectivity and the fact that VUMmx1 is activated upon sucrose stimulation of the antennae and proboscis led to the hypothesis that VUMmx1 mediates the rewarding properties of sucrose. VUMmx1 stimulation does not lead to proboscis extension. Yet, activity of this neuron has been found to be sufficient to mediate the reward in olfactory conditioning (Hammer 1993) . In other words, pairing of an odorant with an artificial depolarization of VUMmx1 generated by injecting current into the neuron is the equivalent of having experienced an odorant followed by sucrose. As a consequence, a bee treated in this way learns to respond with a PER to the odorant even if it had never experienced real sucrose associated to it. How gustatory sucrose receptors convey information to VUMmx1 is still unknown, but it is thought that they project to the SEG where they would synapse directly or indirectly onto VUMmx1. Given that VUMmx1 is an octopaminergic neuron, in a further study, local octopamine injections into the antennal lobes or the mushroom body did also substitute for sucrose reward during olfactory conditioning (Hammer and Menzel 1998) ; accordingly, downregulation of the octopamine receptor through RNAi technique reduces olfactory learning (Farooqui et al. 2003) .\n\n In the central ventral portion of the SEG, Schr\u00f6 ter et al. (2007) identified 10 different VUM neurons, 6 of which innervate neuropile regions of the brain and the SEG exclusively (central VUM neurons) and 4 with axons in peripheral nerves (peripheral VUM neurons). They are putatively octopaminergic and therefore might be involved in octopaminergic modulation of behavior. Central VUM neurons innervate the antennal lobes, the protocerebral lobes (including the lateral horn), and the mushroom body calyces. Among these neurons, a neuron termed VUMmd1 whose soma lies in the mandibular neuromere exhibits the same branching pattern in the brain as VUMmx1 and responds to sucrose and odors in a similar way. However, no experiment has been so far performed to show that, like VUMmx1, it can also substitute for reward in PER olfactory conditioning. Peripheral VUM neurons innervate the antennal and the mandibular nerves, thus suggesting that they receive gustatory and mechanosensory input from antennae and mandibles. VUM neurons as recorded by Schr\u00f6ter et al. (2007) not only responded to sucrose; in some cases, they responded to water and salt thus making the question of taste encoding in the bee brain even more complex. Interestingly, the anatomical pendant of VUMmx1 has been found in the brain of Drosophila larvae (Thum A, personal communication) and adults (Busch et al. 2009 ) as well as in moths Manduca sexta (Dacks et al. 2005) . In both cases, the soma is located in the SEG, medioventrally at the midline, and the neuron innervates the antennal lobes, lateral horns, and calyces of the mushroom bodies. Functional studies are missing in these insects to determine whether or not these neurons also mediate the reinforcing properties of appetitive reward in olfactory learning as shown for the honeybee (Hammer 1993) .\n\n Other neurons in the central nervous system of honeybees exhibit significant responses upon antennal and proboscis stimulation with sucrose. For instance, the PE1 neuron (Mauelshagen 1993) , a neuron arising from the peduncle of the mushroom bodies and which has extensive arborizations in the median and lateral protocerebrum, exhibits increased spiking activity upon sucrose stimulation; yet, this neuron also responds to odors and mechanical stimulations, and no other tastants have been assayed to determine its gustatory tuning so that its role in gustatory coding is unclear. The same applies to the so-called feedback neurons (Gr\u00fc newald 1999) , which connect the output regions of the mushroom bodies (alpha and beta lobes, and peduncle) with their ipsilateral input region (ipsilateral calyx).", "qa": [["72_52837501_12_1", "How do VUM neurons in the honeybee brain contribute to olfactory conditioning and reward processing?", "VUM neurons, such as VUMmx1 and VUMmd1, play a role in olfactory conditioning and reward processing in honeybees.

The recent trend prefers mesalazine and olsalazine to sulfasalazine due to their lesser frequent adverse effects but its potential myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity still must be considered 2, 3 . Nephrotoxicity is manifested as indolent interstitial nephritis that -if not diagnosed and treated -can progress to terminal renal failure even after preparation withdrawal. Nephrotoxicity must be suspected in any case of renal function impairment in a patient treated with 5-ASA 2 .

Moreover, since some patients with chronic epilepsy are known to be followed by their general practitioner (GP) in primary care and hence may not show up in the in-or outpatient care registries with an epilepsy, or epilepsy-related diagnosis [6] , we calculated the shares of the prescribed amounts of the six drugs that had no other indication than epilepsy-phenobarbiturate (in Sweden, epilepsy is the only indication for phenobarbiturate when prescribed in outpatient care), primidone, ethosuximide, vigabatrin, felbamate and levetiracetam-that could not be attributed to epilepsy according (1) and (2) above and that were prescribed in primary care by a GP.

Both studies were designed to support decision-making for prioritizing investments in health [30, 31] .\n\n Since their introduction, there have been many criticisms of the use of DALYs, partly because of their complexity, but also owing to ethical problems and controversies around the use of parameters such as the differential societal value of individuals at different ages, the disability weights, and the discount rate [32] . This controversy was no different in Chile, where there was opposition to the potential use of DALYs to design basic packages and demand subsidies.\n\n However, DALYs were instrumental in emphasizing the importance of leading causes of disability, such as depression, substance abuse, and musculoskeletal disorders. Chileans were conscious of the relevance of these health needs in a rapidly ageing population, as shown in health perception studies, and this helped to validate the use of the indicator.\n\n The results of the burden of diseases study had a profound impact on reorienting health policies ( Figure 1 ). The study measured the mental health burden for the first time, as well as other chronic conditions, and led to plans to address them [33] . Subsequently, the MOH performed the first study on the cost-effectiveness of health interventions, using cost per DALY averted. These initiatives were instrumental in institutionalizing epidemiological analysis capacities within the MOH and defining an agenda for strengthening public health surveillance. Using both studies, the MOH proposed a first model for prioritizing health interventions, adapted from Bobadilla\u00b4s work, which would later be used to define health priorities for the new health reform in 2000 ( Figure 2 ) [34] .\n\n Health inequality between population groups and inequality in access to health care were the focus of attention during this period. In 1998, the MOH, together with the Pan American Health Organization, convened an international seminar on 'Equity and efficiency in decision-making in health', fostering broader discussion on these issues. The main topics were the impact of the social determinants of health, geographical inequality in the burden of diseases, and the mismatch of the health system to the priority needs. The burden of disease demonstrates the preponderance of non-communicable diseases, and despite increased investment during the 1990s, the public health system still lacked the resources to address the new health priorities. Therefore, the private-public gap remained a significant equality concern [35, 36] .\n\n The discussion also covered MOH strategies to address inequality in access, including the new public insurance (FONASA) prioritizing the benefits mechanism, such as the 'program of complex services', based primarily on cost and waiting lists, instead of epidemiological criteria.\n\n In 2000, a new cycle of health reforms began in an attempt to reduce inequalities. The Chilean government implemented an innovative second-generation health reform, the central focus of which was the recognition of the right to health. A physician headed the Inter-ministerial Committee leading the process, which involved the Ministries of Health and Finance, and the General Secretariat of the Presidency [37] . On this occasion, the reform was designed without technical or financial support from donor agencies, and included a new legal framework for the health system. It made extensive use of data and national studies.\n\n The first step was the definition of health objectives for the decade 2000-2010, called 'Objetivos Sanitarios para la D\u00e9cada 2000-2010' (OS2000-10) (Figure 3 ). OS2000-10 provided strategic direction and set the rules for all the different actors involved in health reform, as well as establishing a baseline to evaluate the impact of the reform [38] . Two aspects are worthy of particular attention. The first was the inclusion of an objective on people's expectations of the health system (out-of-pocket payments, responsiveness, and quality of services), influenced by the World Health Report 2000 conceptual framework. The second was the explicit priority setting, based on national data, which used the model developed previously, based on DALYs and cost-effectiveness. The proposal was broadly discussed and approved, during public hearings, by several professional and non-governmental organizations, including representatives of the health industry [38] .\n\n The primary instrument for achieving health goals was the creation of a regime of explicit health guarantees (known by the acronym AUGE) for prioritized health problems (law 19.966, 2004) [39] .

After 36 h, the control (without dieckol) stretched out in the gel and formed many branched and elongated structures in type I collagen matrix (Figure 3(b) ). In contrast, the branches were reduced in the cells treated with 5 \u03bcM concentration of dieckol. As the concentration increased to 100 \u03bcM, these branches disappeared and cells changed to spherical shape. \n\n Line. Gelatin zymography analysis was performed, for investigating whether dieckol could inhibit protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. As shown in Figure 4 (a), protein expressions for MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly inhibited by dieckol in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, results from the RT-PCR and western blot revealed that the expression of MMP-2 and -9 was inhibited at transcription levels by dieckol, more or less similar manner with zymography analysis (Figures 4(b) and 4(c) ).\n\n Expressions on HT1080 Cell Line. Western blot studies were carried out to assay the downregulation effects of dieckol on the possible mechanism of expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Meanwhile, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) was been checked by western blot. As shown in Figure 5(b) , dieckol did not exhibit a clear influence of activator protein-1 (AP-1) (c-jun) expression and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK, JNK, p38), which mediated the AP-1. The NF-\u03baB transcription family proteins consist of several protein subunits, and it was clear that the level of NF-\u03baB (p65 and p50) was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 expression was increased significantly, when treated with high concentration of dieckol (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 5(a) ). As observed in Figure 5(c) , there is no distinct change in the expressions of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 when treated with different concentrations of dieckol.\n\n MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, participate in many physiological and pathological processes. An imbalance between the inhibition and activation of MMPs is related to some diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor metastasis, cardiovascular diseases and congestive heart failure [18] [19] [20] . Finding MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) for treatment of these prevalent diseases has been an important aspect of present day cancer research [21] . MMPIs regulate MMPs at several biochemical pathways, but most of them directly inhibit the activity of enzyme. Till now, MMPIs entering clinical trial are only of synthetic origin (organic compounds) and have failed to enter the pharmaceutical market owing to their side effects [22] . The search for novel and natural compounds has led to the discovery of oceans as the treasure house of substances with amazing pharmacological potential. Therefore, discovering the ideal MMPIs from marine natural sources is feasible and more advantageous [23] .\n\n Ecklonia cava (a marine alga), one of the marine floral members, produces dieckol which has been well studied previously to inhibit the expression of various MMPs [12, 24] . In this study, dieckol did not show any cytotoxic effect on HT1080 cells at the concentrations below 200 \u03bcM. However, dieckol influenced the cell mobility as measured by transwell invasion assay; it also suppressed HT1080 cells crossing the matrix gel in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we have examined the effect of dieckol on the organization of HT1080 cells in a 3D culture environment. In vivo, cells experience a 3D environment and are surrounded by other cells and ECM.", "qa": [["52_17869683_2_1", "How does dieckol affect tumor invasion in HT1080 cells?\n", "Dieckol treatment reduces cell invasion in HT1080 cells, and a concentration of 100 \u03bcM significantly blocks tumor invasion.

The Youth Suicide study explored how young people think about suicide and self-harm and specifically how young people's understandings of how distress relating to gender identity or sexuality could lead to suicide. The researchers found that young people view suicide as accessible and rational, and that self-harm was used and perceived as a common coping strategy by young people [16, 17] . The researchers did not specifically explore the way in which disclosures of self-harm and suicidal behaviour were made by the participants.\n\n All eleven focus group transcripts were reviewed to identify those that contained mental-health related selfdisclosures, i.e. self-disclosure of personal history of selfharm, suicidal intention, depression or other mental health problems. Those transcripts that were found to include one or more mental health related self-disclosure were then reviewed in more detail using a deductive framework analysis approach [18] to determine if the style of disclosures compared to those identified through analysis of the Somerset Health Panel data. This was performed by coding the data using the framework and specifically the disclosure part of the coding structure derived from the inductive analysis of the Somerset Health Panel data.\n\n NVivo8 was used to facilitate data management and analysis. Two colleagues also reviewed two of the same transcripts and discussion regarding coding and interprettation ensured validity of analysis. For each quote used within this article a reference is provided to the focus group and participant-i.e. \"A3\" refers to focus group A, participant 3. In addition, the archive data reference is provided in Table 1 .\n\n Six out of the eleven Youth Suicide study focus groups included at least one mental health related self-disclosure.\n\n The self-disclosure rate was similar to the Somerset Health Panels, with 15/66 (23%) of participants self-disclosing a history of depression, self-harm or suicidal intention (Table 1).\n\n The two distinct styles of announcers and confessors and their relative characteristics were identifiable within the Youth Suicide data. In both datasets, overall there were more announcers than confessors, with the proportion of announcers slightly higher in the Youth Suicide study (although numbers are too small to test if this is a significant difference). For example announcer K3 disclosed their self-harming behaviour without prompting from others or any preceding general statements to gauge the attitudes of others:\n\n I\n\n Consistent with the previous findings, K3 announces they self-harm then immediately transitions in the latter half of the excerpt from the disclosure into a more confident contribution-and later in the transcript takes a role as self-appointed \"expert\", making statements regarding background science and generalising from their own experience.\n\n Throughout the discussions there were also numerous examples of non-mental health related self-disclosures. The discussion topics covered by the groups included sexual preferences and risk taking behaviours (drinking and taking drugs). Self-disclosures were made about all of these by many of the participants. Most of these disclosures were also announced in a direct way and it was clear that the group were not inhibited about talking about these issues in front of others (the facilitator or their peers).\n\n In Figure 2 an announcement of drug use by participant I3 is clearly not affected by the potentially inhibiting comments made by others in the group. A number of participants made multiple disclosures during the discussion. Where this occurred, in all but one case each disclosure by the same participant followed a similar styleas either announcer (Figure 3) or confessor (Figure 4) .\n\n In the first example (Figure 3) , the announcer (G2) discloses both self-harm and suicidal intent at different stages in the discussion without any prompting. In comparison, as found in the Somerset Health Panel data, the pathway for the confessor (I4) is more complex, where negative statements from others delay disclosure, and where they check what reactions might be with more general abstract statements prior to the disclosure (FigCopyright \u00a9 \n\n In both examples, although the first disclosure related to self-harm and the second to suicidal intent, this may be due to the order of the topic guide rather than a natural order. In all cases, as found in the Somerset Health Panel data and as can be seen in the examples above (K3, G2, I4), the discloser (announcer or confessor) then subsequently contributes more confidently, taking on the self-appointed role of \"expert\" on that topic for the remainder of the discussion.", "qa": [["80_44139390_1_1", "What are some common coping strategies used by young people in relation to distress?\n", "The researchers found that self-harm was used and perceived as a common coping strategy by young people.

These results suggest that the proteolytic domain of uPA is not required for chemotaxis. Furthermore, antibodymediated inhibition of uPAR blocked chemotaxis whereas rescue with exogenous uPAR reversed these effects (83) . The distribution of uPAR is also different between actively migrating and non-migrating cells. While uPAR is more preferentially distributed on the apical side or the focal contacts on the surface of non-migrating cells (84, 85) , however, during migration, it redistributes at the leading edge of the migrating cells (86) . In this way, uPAR regulates the concentration and activity of uPA at the required sites on the surface of migrating cells.\n\n It has been shown that the components of the uPA system are expressed in various types of hemopoietic cells (78) . More importantly, their levels are altered during the course of infections suggesting the role of the uPA-uPAR system in mediating different types of immune response (87) (88) (89) . In response to bacterial infection, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are released, which in turn increases uPA expression and secretion by different types of monocytes, neutrophils, epithelial and endothelial cells (87) . Upon its local release, uPA causes the activation of neutrophils, primes them to produce superoxide and potentiates their migration by a pathway that can be either dependent or independent of uPAR (90) (91) (92) (93) . When uPA is knocked out, it hampered the ability of the mice immune system to recruit neutrophils and macrophages in response to the exposure to Cryptococcus neoformans (strain 52D) bacteria, ultimately leading to uncontrolled infection and death of the animals (94) . Like uPA, its receptor uPAR also plays an important role in innate immune response through the regulation of cell adhesion, migration in a manner dependent or independent of uPA (88) . The uPAR deficient mice also failed to recruit neutrophils and macrophages at the site of bacterial infection (95, 96) .\n\n The uPA system has also been implicated in adaptive immunity. The expressions of both uPA and its receptor uPAR are augmented during T-cell activation compared with their levels in resting or naive T cells (97) . In uPA-deficient mice, the T helper 1 and 2 (Th1 and Th2) effector lymphocytes lose the ability to respond to pathogen attack (98, 99) . On the other hand, blockade of uPAR restricts the migration of leukocytes in vitro (100) and also hampers the recruitment of T-cells in vivo (101) . Collectively, all these studies make it evident that the uPA-uPAR system is at the fringe between fibrinolysis, immune response mechanisms, and pathology (88) . In addition, the uPA system is also involved in the male reproductive system where it can enhance sperm mobility, stimulate acrosome reaction, and promote fertilization (102) . These district effects of uPA led Qin et al. to demonstrate that targeting uPA may serve as a novel strategy for male contraception (103) . These and other physiological functions of the uPA-uPAR system are summarized in Figure 4 .\n\n The following section summarizes the functional role of the uPA system in different steps of cancer progression.\n\n The key mechanism that underlies tumorigenesis includes a combination of enhanced cell proliferation and suppression of apoptotic cell death (6) . It has been shown that the components of the uPA system can increase cell proliferation through the proteolytic activation of different types of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), EGF, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and TGF-\u03b2 as well as adhesion molecules such as the \u03b15\u03b21 integrins (6, 104, 105) . Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of the uPA-uPAR system during the early stages of tumor formation. For example, the progression of melanoma was impaired in uPA-deficient mice (106) . However, inhibition of uPA did not impair the progression of pancreatic cancer in the well-characterized RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (107), FigURe 4 | The major physiological roles of the uPA-urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) system.", "qa": [["2_3641338_4_1", "How does the uPA-uPAR system play a role in immune response?\n", "The uPA-uPAR system is involved in mediating different types of immune responses.
