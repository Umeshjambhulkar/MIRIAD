Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

The second relates to the marked site-specificity of clinical Acanthamoeba infection: is corneal tissue unduly susceptible to amoebic infection? To answer these questions we studied the interaction of Acanthamoeba and cell cul tures. We first investigated whether Acantha moeba excysts in the presence of cultured cells, and whether a cytopathic effect (CPE) results. We then conducted a comparative investigation of the effect of amoebic tropho zoites on primary cultures of human and rab bit corneal cells, and on 3T3 alpha cells, a mouse fibroblast cell line. We contrasted the CPEs of Acanthamoeba spp. on these cells, and compared an environmental isolate with an isolate from an infected cornea.\n\n \n\n Two strains of Acanthamoeba were used in these studies: an isolate from an infected cor nea, A. polyphaga (Davies), and a soil isolate of A. castellanii (Neff) .

Because limited data are available, the actual clearance rate for the topical treatment of sBCC with 5-FU is currently unknown. Application of 5-FU causes severe local skin reactions, including pain and burning, pruritus, irritation, inflammation, swelling, tenderness, hyperpigmentation, and scarring. (48)\n\n Imiquimod is a member of a newer class of agents called immune-response modifiers. Imiquimod is currently approved by the FDA in the treatment of external genital and perianal warts and actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. The mechanism of action of imiquimod is thought to occur through the activation of macrophages and other cells via binding to cellsurface receptors, such as Toll-like receptor (89) . This binding activity induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g.interferon-\u03b1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 ) favoring a type 1 helper T-cell-mediated immune response because of the generation of cytotoxic effector cells Investigators noted a significant correlation between the histologic clearance rate and severity of local skin reactions (i.e. erythema, erosion, and scabbing/crusting) commonly experienced during treatment with imiquimod 5% cream. The data suggested that as the severity of these three local skin reactions increased, there was a greater trend in histologic clearance of sBCC (48) . In addition to sBCC, imiquimod also has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of nBCC.50,56 (90, 91) Treatment with imiquimod once daily, seven times per week, for either 6 or 12 weeks resulted in nBCC histologic clearance rates of 71% to 76% (90). Because imiquimod promotes an inflammatory reaction to treat the tumor, treatment is generally associated with mild to-moderate local skin reactions, with severity related to frequency of application (92, 93) . In a phase II study, the most common local skin reactions were erythema, crusting, flaking, and erosion (92) . However, these dose-related side-effects were generally well tolerated, and none of the patients discontinued because of local skin reactions. In addition to monotherapy, imiquimod 5% cream may also be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of BCC. Treatment with imiquimod significantly reduced the size of the target tumor and thereby resulted in a smaller cosmetic defect from the MMS excision compared with vehicle. Adjunctive therapy with imiquimod reduced the frequency of residual tumor with ED & C compared with ED & C alone and also appeared to improve cosmetic appearance. These studies suggest that imiquimod 5% cream may be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of nBCC (48).\n\n BCC treatments have many advantages and disadvantages, which depend on many factors, including tumor type, tumor location, cosmetic considerations, and physician and patient convenience. Surgical procedures such as MMS and surgical excision have the lowest 5-year recurrence rates (Table 4 ). However, effective clearance of BCC tumors with surgical procedures is highly dependent on tumor margins and the skill of the healthcare provider. Thissen et al. (81) recommend that surgical excision is preferred over common procedures such as cryosurgery and ED & C, provided surgery is not contraindicated. With PDT, there is limited tissue penetration (i.e. depth), a critical requirement when treating invasive tumors. Mohs micrographic surgery is recommended for larger BCC tumors in high-risk areas of the face and head and for tumors with aggressive growth patterns (81) . \n\n \n\n The likelihood of BCC recurrence may be influenced by one or more factors( Table 2 ). In addition to fthe tumor's treatment, the cancer's biologic behavior and the patient's immune status are related to the incidence of tumor recurrence. For example, in immunosuppressed individuals, BCCs not only demonstrate more aggressive biologic behavior but also have a significantly higher recurrence rate as compared with this malignancy in patients who have an intact immune system (94) . The histologic subtype of BCC influences the biologic behavior of the tumor. Recurrent BCCs are commonly associated with a primary cancer that has an aggressive histologic subtype (95) (96) (97) (98) .\n\n Also, BCCs with aggressive histologic patterns require more aggressive treatment; in addition, when the Mohs micrographic surgical technique is used, a greater number of stages are required to achieve tumor free margins as compared with BCCs without aggressive tumor growth patterns (99) . Inadequate treatment of BCCMH may represent an unsuspected etiology for recurrent skin cancer. For example, an unexpected aggressive pathologic pattern of BCC may not be detected after a superficial biopsy. Subsequently, the cancer may recur if the initial treatment for the diagnosed nonaggressive tumor subtype is inadequate for the undiscovered aggressive carcinoma. Clinical recurrence of cancer results when there has been persistence of the original tumor secondary to inadequate eradication (54) . The recurrence rate for BCC lesions with positive margins calculated from the aggregated data is 27 percent (72) . The reported percent of BCC recurrence varies depending on the treatment modality (54) . Recurrent BCC (rBCC) is known to be a high-risk tumour with a worse prognosis than primary BCC (50, 59, 76, 100) . This may be due to the fact that scar tissue can cover residual tumour fields or because the appearance of basaloid tumour cells in recurrent tumours is frequently squamified, lacy and morpheaform, which may be easily missed in scar tissue (76) . The only RCT investigating treatment modalities in rBCC showed that after 5 years of follow-up MMS is the preferred treatment for facial rBCC because of statistically significant lower recurrence rates (101) . Besides tumour characteristics, patient characteristics are of importance when choosing a treatment for an individual. In a few cases where surgery is impossible or undesirable, it may be advantageous to treat a patient with a different, possibly less effective, treatment. Particular management difficulties are posed by recurrent tumours. In general, they are best treated by Mohs' micrographic surgery in high-risk sites and excision elsewhere.", "qa": [["67_56722902_7_1", "What are the advantages and disadvantages of surgical procedures for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC)?\n", "Surgical procedures, such as Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) and surgical excision, have the lowest 5-year recurrence rates for BCC.

In these demonstrations participants were shown how to cook the recipes and given other relevant information such as seasonal ingredient substitutes, brief nutrition information on ingredients, or the cheapest or best place to buy these ingredients. These demonstrations generally lasted around 15 min. Immediately after each demonstration, participants cooked the same meal in their allocated pairs before consuming the meal in one large group. For each recipe, study assistants pre-prepared trays of portioned raw ingredients for each participant pair. The trays included a two-serve recipe, with some items, e.g., spices and herbs, allocated more liberally so the students could adjust to their own taste preferences.

It has been found that elevated levels of circulating homocysteine are a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease which is the most popular hypothesis for the etiopathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Sorensen et al found that second trimester elevation of homocysteine was associated with 3.2 fold increased risk of pre-eclampsia. 11 Acilmis et al concluded that maternal and fetal serum homocysteine levels were found to be significantly higher in severe pre-eclampsia group compared to mild pre-eclampsia and control groups suggesting that elevated serum levels of homocysteine might be associated with severity of pre-eclampsia. 12 It has been hypothesized that in vitro, homocysteine enhances spontaneous contractions of myometrium. Applying the same it has been postulated that high homocysteine in early pregnancy leads to preterm labour. Murphy et al showed that raised homocysteine is associated with preterm delivery and also Vollset et al reported a strong association of preterm labour and homocysteine measured either before or after pregnancy. 2, 13 Similarly in our study the mean homocysteine level in subjects having preterm labour was 16.37 \u00b5mol/L which was higher than normal levels but a statistically significant relation could not be established (OR=1.00 ,95% CI: 0.23-4.34).\n\n In this study homocysteine level in subjects with IUGR is lower than normal subjects but not significant statistically (OR=0.64,95%CI: 0.13-3.09). Infante-Rivard et al also showed, there was an inverse association between plasma homocysteine and the risk of IUGR.\n\n 14 Contrary to our study Jan Urban et al found that mean homocysteine level in group with IUGR was 11.5 ng/dl, significantly higher than in normal pregnancy (9.5 ng/dl).\n\n In present study subjects who had hypothyroidism had lower mean homocysteine level than normal, though it was not statistically significant (OR=1.0,95% CI: 0.17-5.84). Against our study Catarqi et al in 1999 found that homocysteine level to be elevated in hypothyroid cases. 16 They postulated that hypothyroidism decreases hepatic levels of enzymes involved in remethylation pathway of homocysteine. Similarly Diekman et al concluded that plasma homocysteine levels increased in hypothyroidism. 17 Vollset et al investigated associations between tHcy and complications and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. 2 When they compared the upper with the lower quartile of plasma tHcy, the adjusted risk for preeclampsia was 32% higher [odds ratio (OR): 1.32; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.77; P for trend = 0.02], that for prematurity was 38% higher (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.75; P for trend = 0.005), and that for very low birth weight was 101% higher (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.23,3.27; P for trend = 0.003). When the cut off value of homocysteine was taken as 15 \u00b5mol/L as quoted by Vollset we found that in 93.3% of cases of preeclampsia there was hyperhomocysteinemia which was statistically significant (p=0.044) rest other complications had not shown any statistical significant association with hyperhomocysteinemia.\n\n reported that elevated total plasma homocysteine during pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. 13 Bergen et al concluded that higher homocysteine concentration in early pregnancy have higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. 18 Refsum H reported that women having high homocysteine levels are at increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcome. 19 However, none of these studies tested the accuracy of a defined cut-off value for prediction of pregnancy complications with an adequate accuracy. In our study too mean homocysteine level of subjects with complication in present pregnancy is higher than subjects with no complication but the difference is not significant statistically. This is probably due to small number of women with different complications in this study.\n\n Despite the fact that significant difference in mean homocysteine levels in women with pregnancy complications and those without pregnancy complications has been seen in various studies, it is still not known if there is a cut-off value that could predict pregnancy complications with adequate accuracy. In Indian context with wide spread nutritional deficiencies, it is difficult to comment if high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia is a measure of nutritional deficiency.

We detected bright GFE-qdot luminescence in the lungs (Fig. 3a) , and its appearance was inhibited when the qdots were coinjected with cilastatin, similar to the in vitro studies (Fig. 3b) . The GFE qdots were not found in various other organs (Fig. 3c, brain and Fig. 3d, kidney) , except those with a prominent reticuloendothelial component (see below). Furthermore, we did not observe any acute toxicity, even after 24 h of circulation, caused by the i.v. administration of these nanoparticles (i.e., overt thrombosis or signs of complement activation).\n\n Qdots coated with peptides that home to tumor vasculature were examined in an MDA-MB-435 xenograft tumor system. Intravenously injected F3-coated and LyP-1-coated qdots accumulated in these tumors. As expected from their specificity for tumor blood vessels (10) and lymphatic vessels (11), the F3 and LyP-1 qdots targeted distinct structures within the tumors. The signal from F3-coated qdots colocalized with coinjected blood vessel marker lectin (Fig. 4a) . The LyP-1-coated qdots did not Fig. 3 . In vivo targeting of qdots to normal lung vasculature is specific. Red GFE-conjugated qdots were injected into the tail vein of normal mice, and the presence of qdots in lung tissue was assessed by examining sections under a confocal microscope with UV excitation and a 585-nm long-pass filter (a and b) or an epifluorescent microscope as in Fig. 2 (c and d) . colocalize with the lectin (Fig. 4b) or F3 qdots (Fig. 4c) . They did colocalize with the lymphatic vessel marker, podoplanin (21) (not shown), as has been shown previously for f luoresceinlabeled LyP-1 peptide (11). GFE-coated qdots injected as a control were not detected in the tumors (Fig. 4d) . Brain, heart, kidney, or skin did not contain detectable qdots (Fig. 4e and data not shown), indicating specificity of the F3 and LyP-1 qdots for tumor components. The regional specificity of qdot delivery within a tumor demonstrates the feasibility of targeting functionally distinct components of a tumor (e.g., blood vessels vs. lymphatics, etc.). Furthermore, the subcellular pattern of qdot luminescence suggests that peptide-coated nanostructures are internalized after binding to the cell surface, which may have implications for drug delivery and other applications that require intracellular targeting (Fig. 4f ) .\n\n System. The in vivo-injected qdots, regardless of the peptide used for the coating, accumulated in both the liver and spleen, in addition to the targeted tissues. The mononuclear phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, characterized by their ability to mediate nonspecific uptake of circulating particulates, apparently participated in the clearance of a fraction of circulating qdots in our experimental system. Adsorption-resistant coatings such as PEG are often used to minimize recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, thereby increasing circulation halflife (22) . We prepared LyP-1 qdots with and without PEG coating and found that PEG nearly eliminated the nonspecific uptake into the liver and spleen (Fig. 5) . Based on quantification of qdot fluorescence with digital image analysis, we estimate that coadsorption of PEG with peptide on the surface of qdots reduced the accumulation in the liver and spleen by about 95%. The PEG coating did not noticeably alter qdot accumulation in tumor tissue.\n\n In this article, we demonstrate the selective targeting of peptidecoated qdots to the vasculature of normal lungs and tumors, showing that it is possible to target hybrid organic\u035einor-ganic nanometer-sized colloidal material in a living mammal. In the future, the components and functions of a nanosystem will not be limited to peptide\u035esemiconductor composites and luminescence.\n\n Our peptide-coated qdots showed excellent homing specificity for the relevant vascular site, but we did not see accumulation of fluorescence within the targeted tissue. This finding is in contrast to what we have seen when the two tumor-homing peptides, F3 and LyP-1, were coupled to fluorescein. In that case, there was accumulation of fluorescence not only in the blood or lymphatic vessels, but also in the tumor cells. It is also possible that qdots did not penetrate into the tissue. The uncoated qdots have a diameter of 3.5 nm (green) or 5.5 nm (red) (14) , which is equivalent to about 40 kDa, and the peptide coating adds another about 150 kDa. This may be a sufficiently large size to impede tissue penetration. However, F3 and LyP-1 qdots accumulated less well in cultured cells than the fluorescein-labeled peptide. It may be that the qdots were not sufficiently stable to remain luminescent in living cells and tissues.

There is a direct relationship between the viscero-visceral reflex and visceral pain [34] . Visceral pain is a general sign involved in many gastro-duodenal and gastro-colonic disorders, such as colic, inflammatory processes, and other diseases. These symptoms are accompanied by stimulation of the HPA (neuropeptides, hormones, e.g., cortisol) and SAS (catecholamine, 5-HT, neuropeptides) axes and the exacerbation of motivational and motor CNS structures (limbic system) involved in many quinine, neuropeptides, and necrohormones release useful in alarm reactions and defense of animals.\n\n I.C.V. application of VGCCIs in 10 min premedication prevented nocifensive signs of behavior, clinical symptoms, increase plasma cortisol and catecholamine concentration in periphery, and perhaps in CNS structures, as well. The molecular mechanisms of these processes are the result of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitors blockage of specific Ca 2+ receptors by the drugs tested. Calcium channels receptor blockage by VGCC inhibitors attenuates visceral pain by inhibiting nocifensive neurohormone/neurotransmitters release in CNS and in peripheral nervous system, due to the fact that Ca 2+ ions cannot bind to their specific receptor for depolarization of presynaptic neuronal membrane and promote the release of nocifensive substances.\n\n Voltage-gated calcium channels are made with subunit \u03b1 1 which forms a channel pore and subunit \u03b1 2\u03b4 , which facilitates movement to the membrane surface [35] . There are ten different \u03b1 1\u03b4 subtypes and four \u03b1 2\u03b4 . \u03b1 2\u03b41 and \u03b1 2\u03b42 subtypes bind gabapentin and pregabalin. Subtype 1 exists principally in the intermediate matrix (dentate gyrus, insula, cortex, and amygdala) [36] .\n\n Subtypes \u03b1 2\u03b41 exhibit expression also in dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord and in the small intestine smooth muscle, together with N-type calcium channels [36] . Subtype 2 is found in the periaqueductal gray matter, spinal cord and as diffused all over CNS, but not in the colon or duodenal smooth muscle [37] . Pregabalin and gabapentin bind with subtypes \u03b1 2\u03b4 in the cytoplasm and prevent calcium channels expression on the plasmatic membranes [38] . Preventing the binding and expression blocks calcium conductance and in consequence substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and glutamate cannot be released from primary afferent neurons [35, 39] . Prevention of nocifensive neurotrasmitters release by gabapentine and pregabaline occurs only during pathological processes, in which calcium channels are up-regulated and activated [40] . Both pregabaline and gabapentine are central analgesics [39] . Gabapentinoids inhibited visceral hypersensitivity in the experimental animals, as well as irritable bowel syndrome in humans [41] . Smalls doses of gabapentine administered with morphine inhibit i.p. acid injection induced writhing syndrome in rats, which were ineffective when the drugs were applied separately.\n\n Gabapentenoids not only inhibit central nociceptive transmission, but also enhance the intestine susceptibility to distension, possibly by blockage of \u03b1 2\u03b4 subtypes in the smooth muscle [42, 43] .\n\n Other calcium channels can be also involved in the development of visceral hypersensitivity. Stimulation of T-type calcium channels, subtype Ca v 3.2 on the primary signaling visceral afferents was associated with symptoms similar to the irritable bowel syndrome in the animal model. Behavioral symptoms resolved after the application of T-type calcium channels inhibitor [44] . Afferent transduction from mesentery in the experimental intestinal ischaemia was blocked by nifedipine, an L-type calcium channels inhibitor [45] .\n\n The results of this investigation indicates, that VGCCIs can be applied effectively in visceral pain modulation of animals and could be paid to the use of this kind of medicine, perhaps in human pain treatment as well.", "qa": [["29_62893158_5_1", "What are the potential causes of visceral pain in animals?\n", "Visceral pain in animals can be caused by various gastro-duodenal and gastro-colonic disorders, such as colic, inflammatory processes, and other diseases.

However, it is still unknown whether intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes is a risk factor for the subsequent development of insulin resistance in appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) infants.\n\n Leptin, the product of the ob gene, specially secreted from adipose tissue, has brought new insight into the regulation of the energy balance [3] . A relationship has been observed between circulating levels of leptin and the intrauterine growth pattern [4] and between leptin and insulin levels [5] . Furthermore, leptin has been hypothe-sized as an insulin counter-regulatory hormone that might be involved not only in obesity and energy partition, but also in the brain development and in the pathogenesis of diabetes [6] [7] .

In case of skewed distribution data are showed as mean (95% confidence interval).

At reconstruction, a Whitaker test was performed in all 52 renal units and in only two was there evidence of obstruction. Renal biopsy in nine revealed dysplasia as was to be expected and at a median of 11 years post-treatment 11 patients had a renal failure. However, this study was conducted after a significant period of diversion during which time it could be argued that any obstructive element may have resolved with the detrusor being 'rested'.\n\n Rare reports exist of the outcome of apparent ureterovesical obstruction. Noe and Jerkins [22] described two infants in whom there was rapid upper tract dilatation following valve ablation. These infants were treated conservatively and the dilatation remitted.\n\n In 1980, Krueger [23] and colleagues reported improved body growth and renal function in patients diagnosed in the first year of life and treated by initial temporary supra-vesical diversion. However, Reinberg et al in 1992 [24] reported that following high diversion (ureterostomy) there was no statistical influence on growth when compared to patients treated by fulguration or vesicostomy. What they did observe was that body growth was significantly related to renal impairment. In the same year, Lyon et al [25] reported different results on long-term follow up (mean 18 years), but body growth being maintained in spite of a higher rate of renal failure. Eight of twenty-five patients underwent diversion and of these five progressed to renal failure, six of 17 not diverted did so, and in all patients this was related to renal function in the first year after surgery. Interestingly, in spite of poorer outcome in terms of renal function, the mean percentage height at age 10 years was 61% of the norm for those diverted and 35% for those not diverted.\n\n Where then do we find ourselves with regard to upper tract diversion in the management of PUVs? The factors that determine renal outcome are first and foremost the degree of pre-existing renal dysplasia followed by detrusor dysfunction and urine infection. The lack of controlled trials concerning management makes a decision regarding the place of diversion difficult, particularly with the conflicting evidence provided. A further confounding issue is that almost all discussion on ureterostomy has been based on the use of either loop or ring ureterostomies. Both these procedures may produce an obstructed system because it is easy to rotate the ureter, a problem avoided by the 'T' (or 'Y') ureterostomy.\n\n I believe that it is inescapable in developed countries where the majority of cases present in the neonatal period, or at least in the first few months of life. The correct and successful first line management is valve ablation with antibiotic cover. The presence of ureteric reflux will demand that chemotherapy is continued up to the age of 5 years, or at the least up to 3 years. All patients should have urodynamic studies performed at perhaps the age of 3 months or as soon as reasonable following valve ablation if performed after this age. The likelihood of there being detrusor hyper-reflexia and limited compliance indicates that anticholinergic medication should be commenced. However, it should be withheld for 7 days before urodynamics to allow the natural situation to be identified. The finding of incomplete voiding indicates the need for intermittent catheterisation three times daily. Some authorities recommend that this is commenced in all infants because it is easier to introduce a catheter at this age, and then it becomes accepted by the child. From the current review, this action does not seem to be well founded. If improvement is gained in renal function and upper tract anatomy, there is no need for further surgery.\n\n The management of patients in whom improvement does not take place demands a consideration of diversion on a temporary basis. Arguments against diversion include (a) the very limited benefit gained because renal function depends on the degree of dysplasia, (b) variable reported detrimental effects on bladder function, and (c) the necessity for serial operative procedures. Arguments in favour of diversion include (a) the rapid control of urosepsis, (b) alleviation of the 'load' on the detrusor muscle, and (c) possible improved body growth. The following scenarios may present themselves following adequate valve ablation: 1. Persistently raised creatinine levels with limited upper tract dilatation. This must be due to renal dysplasia for which diversion is of no benefit. Renal ultrasound may support the impression of dysplasia if both kidneys are seen to be bright, and likely small for the child's age. 2. Persistently dilated upper tracts with improving biochemical values. It is unlikely that diversion will be of benefit. 3. Persistently dilated upper tracts without improve-ment of biochemical values. Confirmation of adequate valve ablation is needed before aggressive management of bladder dysfunction. If this fails to make improvements then there could be a place for diversion. 4. Persistently dilated upper tracts with urosepsis not responding to aggressive chemotherapy. This situation seems to be ideally suited to management by diversion. Diversion provides rapid control of infection with maximal reduction in upper tract pressure. 5. Poor physical growth. It seems inappropriate to perform diversion for this alone.\n\n It remains for us to decide what form of diversion should be performed if such surgery is considered. There seems to be sufficient evidence that vesicostomy, though often successful in overcoming infection, may lead to detrimental effects on bladder function. Percutaneous pyelostomy has been practised but is not a stable situation in the long-term, but has been advocated as a temporary procedure to determine the possible benefit of diversion. However, improvement may be slow and the drainage may easily be lost before proper evaluation is possible. Ureterostomy has been criticised for diverting urine from the bladder. However, if one of the 'chimney' types of anastomosis is performed this problem can be avoided and there is evidence that bladder function may normalise.\n\n In conclusion, I believe that there is still an occasional indication for upper tract diversion in PUVs. The main indication is slowly responding urosepsis, but there may occasionally be an indication when there is persisting upper tract dilatation and failure to achieve improved renal function.", "qa": [["43_12343672_3_1", "What factors contribute to the determination of renal outcome in the management of posterior urethral valves (PUVs)?", "The factors that determine renal outcome in PUVs include the degree of pre-existing renal dysplasia, detrusor dysfunction, and urine infection.

Altering mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism could affect each one of these pathways. For example, blocking the ability to oxidize pyruvate from glucose leads to increased oxidation of fatty acids in MPC-deficient hepatocytes 62 or hepatocytes treated with MSDC-0602. 46 Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism into citrate is also the initial step in de novo lipogenesis ( Figure 2) , and thus inhibiting MPC activity may reduce hepatic lipid synthesis. However, reduced MPC expression or MPC inhibition with UK-5099 did not greatly alter lipid synthesis owing to compensation by increased amounts of glutamine carbons into newly synthesized lipids. 86, 87 In NAFLD driven by insulin resistance, a large proportion of fatty acids delivered to the liver are released from adipose tissue lipolysis. Because the obese liver-specific MPC-deficient mice still are peripherally insulin-resistant, it is likely that enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis drives the triglyceride accumulation in these livers. On the other hand, improving insulin sensitivity would reduce hyperinsulinemia, which then should reduce hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Indeed, treatment with pioglitazone or MSDC-0602 significantly reversed hepatic triglyceride accumulation in high-fat diet-fed mice, 88 potentially by both reducing hepatic de novo lipogenesis and peripheral effects. Taken together, these results suggest that MPC deficiency or inhibition could alter the numerous metabolic pathways regulating hepatic steatosis, but metabolic compensation likely modifies these effects. In our opinion, this further points to the importance of correcting peripheral insulin resistance in the treatment of NASH.\n\n NAFLD and NASH are an increasingly prevalent and costly health burden with no approved therapeutics at this time. The MPC is an attractive target in NASH because of the many metabolic alterations that could occur in both hepatocytes and stellate cells with inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Intriguingly, this MPC-driven pharmacology could have been an unrecognized benefit of treating NASH with pioglitazone. Indeed, pioglitazone treatment decreases TCA cycle flux and anaplerosis in rodent models of NASH. 74 In addition to the liver-centric effects of MPC inhibition, improving peripheral insulin sensitivity with both the traditional and PPARg-sparing TZDs would both target an underlying driver of NAFLD and reduce fatty acid delivery to the liver (Figure 3 ).", "qa": [["73_59304121_5_1", "How does inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism affect hepatic lipid synthesis?\n", "Inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism can reduce hepatic lipid synthesis.

Both STAT6 and NF-\u03baB have been reported to regulate eotaxin-3 expression in various cell types. (31, 32) However, previous studies showed that eotaxin-3 promoter activity was markedly induced following stimulation with either IL-4 or IL-13 in BEAS-2B cells. Addition of TNF-\u03b1 had no additive effect on eotaxin-3 expression, whereas IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 significantly induced the eotaxin-1 expression in BEAS-2B cells. (26, 33) All of these studies consistently demonstrated that STAT6 is critical for eotaxin-3 expression in airway epithelial cells.\n\n The signal transduction pathway is activated by binding of IL-4 to the IL-4R\u03b1 and induces heterodimerization with \u03b3C or the IL-13R\u03b11. In cells of hematopoietic lineage, the type I receptor arises by recruitment of a common gamma chain (\u03b3C), whereas in non- hematopoietic cells, the type II receptor is formed by interaction of IL-4R\u03b1 with IL-13R\u03b11 instead of \u03b3C.

IL-4R\u03b1 associates with JAK1 and \u03b3C with JAK3, whereas IL-13R\u03b11 interacts with either JAK2 or TYK2, but not JAK3. In nonhematopoietic cells such as bronchial epithelial cells, JAK1 or JAK3 can induce phosphorylation of STAT6. Unlike other members of the JAK family, the expression of JAK3 is highly restricted in hematopoietic cells.

In BEAS-2B cells, JAK1 activates IL-4-induced phosphorylation of STAT6. Nonspecific JAK inhibitor (JAK inhibitor I) abolished IL-4-induced phosphorylation of STAT6, while JAK2 specific inhibitor, AG490 could not inhibit the IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells (data not shown). These results indicate that JAK1-STAT6 is responsible for IL-4-mediated signaling in BEAS-2B cells. Wogonin efficiently suppressed IL-4-induced JAK1 and STAT6 activation in bronchial epithelial cells and attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation. The data presented in Fig. 4E suggest that signaling via the IL-4/STAT6 axis is important for the inflammatory reaction in the airway in vivo. Furthermore, wogonin suppressed OVA-induced production of Th2 cytokine IL-4 and STAT6-dependent expression of IgE and chemokines.\n\n Some natural product inhibitors of STAT6 signaling have been previously reported. TMC-264, a fungal secondary metabolite, selectively inhibited IL-4 signaling by interfering phosphorylation of STAT6. (36) Oxacyclododecindione inhibited IL-4-dependent signaling by blocking the binding of activated STAT6 to DNA binding site. (37) In addition, a synthetic STAT6 inhibitor, AS1517499 which synthesized on the basis of the structure of reported STAT6 inhibitor, was able to inhibit IL-13 secretion in cultured human bronchial smooth muscle as well as to decrease airway hyperactivity in BALB/c mice induced by albumin sensitization. (38) Wogonin, a major ingredient of Scutellariae radix, is a natural product widely used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and allergic diseases. (23, 39) To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that wogonin has the potency to inhibit the activation of JAK1 and STAT6, which should greatly contribute to the Th2-mediated inflammatory responses. Although increasing evidence has shown diverse anti-inflammatory actions in various in vitro and in vivo studies, our findings provide the evidence that wogonin could be a useful compound to control cell responses to IL-4-dependent JAK1/STAT6 signaling, deserving a potential therapeutic use for bronchial asthma. IL 4 binds to IL 4R\u03b1, the functional receptor subunit of both the type I receptor (IL 4R\u03b1 and \u03b3C) and type II receptors (IL 4R\u03b1 and IL 13R\u03b11). Once IL 4 binds to its cognate receptor, the associated JAK kinases are activated and phosphorylate conserved tyrosine residues on the receptor via an SH2 domain allowing the JAKs to phosphorylate STAT6. Phosphorylated STAT6 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the promoters of the IL 4 responsive genes, such as those associated with Th2 cell differentiation, airway inflammation, airway hyper responsiveness and epithelial mucous metaplasia. Wogonin inhibits IL 4 induced phosphorylation of JAK1/STAT6 thereby blocks translocation of activated STAT6 into nucleus that is a pivotal role in Th2 mediated airway inflammatory responses.", "qa": [["27_17210455_5_1", "What are the potential therapeutic uses of wogonin in the treatment of bronchial asthma?\n", "Wogonin, a natural product found in Scutellariae radix, has been shown to inhibit the activation of JAK1 and STAT6, which are involved in IL-4-dependent signaling.

Noise is always present and results from the electromagnetic noise caused by the movement of charged particles in the body, small anomalies in the measurement tools and other magnetic objects in the room. 16 Image quality depends on the homogeneity of the magnetic field and any metal introduced anywhere into the field distorts the static magnetic field, which may cause clip artefact (the enhancement and loss of signal). Even non-magnetic materials may cause artefacts by conducting current, which creates a new local magnetic field. 17 The MRI is also calibrated for each patient and the scan required. When new objects enter the scanning room, they may affect the settings that have been entered. Especially after intervention, when the surroundings and attachments to the patient have been altered, it is important to note that the calibration may require refinement. 17 (4) Thermoregulatory issues\n\n Internal thermoregulation is affected under anaesthesia, and radiant heat loss and decreased thermogenic mechanisms lead to hypothermia under most conditions. Recent studies, however, have suggested that RF radiation produced by the scanner may actually lead to heating and is more pronounced in stronger MR magnets and noted more often in 3 T than 1.5 T scanners. Active heating may cause hyperthermia under these circumstances. The prevention of passive heat loss should therefore be adequate to maintain body temperature.\n\n Indwelling thermistors in the bladder should be disconnected from their circuitry, but may remain in situ during investigation, on the condition that they will not cause artefact if the area of investigation is close to the bladder. 2 RF energy is absorbed by bodily tissue and dissipated to the environment as heat. 18 To combat this effect, air conditioners are often left to blow air continuously into the MRI chamber. This may be a problem for patients with a relatively larger body surface area, for example children and infants.\n\n It is important to note that there is a distinction between 'MR safe' and 'MR compatible'. These concepts are outdated terminology and may cause confusion. Therefore, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has revised the terminology to include 'MR conditional' and 'MR unsafe', as the first two terms were often used interchangeably. 'MR safe' implies that the equipment poses no known risk to the patient and environment under MR conditions, but functionality is either not guaranteed or not tested, and 'MR compatible' implies that the equipment is both safe and functions adequately under such conditions. 19 Previously, ferromagnetic anaesthetic machines were used to ventilate patients with long Mapleson-type circuits that were passed through waveguides. Currently, MR compatible anaesthetic machines, vaporisers and ventilators are available. Piped gases and back-up cylinders are also available in aluminium vessels. These systems are not as readily available as other ferromagnetic systems and are more costly, but minimal monitoring requirements must still be met. 3 All leads and wires may have a current induced by the changing magnetic fields and therefore pose a risk of causing burns to the patient. It is imperative that the anaesthetist be aware of this risk. It should also be ensured that the wires and leads are made of a braided material with minimal contact with the patient's skin. The shortest leads possible must be used, keeping in mind that the scanner bed moves in and out of the scanner portal. The wires can also be placed on top of linen to minimise skin contact, as any type of ECG lead may still cause burns. 13 Where possible, fibre-optic or carbon fibre wiring should be used, and it is also important to ensure that no equipment emits RF waves. Mains power supply may also interfere with image quality and should therefore be isolated, filtered or avoided by making use of battery power supply, which should be firmly secured away from the MRI magnets. 2,3,20 Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is not possible with normal ECG leads. Short MR-compatible leads, preferably < 15 cm, and electrodes should be used and placed in a narrow triangle on the patient's chest. ECG monitoring may become affected by the magnetic field and mimic the changes seen in hyperkalaemia during periods of activation due to Faraday's law. 2, 3, 8, 9 Burns related to pulse oximeters have been noted, therefore MR compatible oximeters should be used and cables should be placed as far away from the scanner as possible.", "qa": [["80_81431191_2_1", "What are the factors that can affect the image quality in MRI scans?", "The image quality in MRI scans can be affected by two factors: signal intensity and noise.

This method is inefficient and can sometimes prove embarrassing when a patient reminds the physician of why he or she is there (eg, \"You told me to schedule a follow-up for my diabetes care.\"). Preparation for the visit is key to efficiency and improved patient experience and trust.\n\n Orient | One best practice is to spend the first 1 to 2 minutes of the visit engaged in dialogue with the patient without using the computer at all. Once a welcoming atmosphere has been established, partnership statements such as, \"I'm going to be using the computer from time to help me keep track of things\" will alert the patient of your intent and rationale for using the computer. In a study of medical malpractice and communication, orientation statements proved to be protective while their absence was associated with a history of malpractice.\n\n Information Gathering | Recent scholarship suggests that some parts of the encounter should be centered on the physician and others should be centered on the patient or physician-patient relationship. 10 Using the computer during informationgathering segments of the visit is both appropriate and expected by patients. Although this process may seem counterintuitive, if you do not enter information into the computer from time to time, you risk patients questioning how seriously you take their concerns. Timing is everything.\n\n Share | The computer is a wonderful source of information and patients appreciate it when they feel like they are partners in the care process. Turning the computer screen so patients can see what you are typing has the double benefit of partnership and serves as a way to check that what is being typed is what was said or meant.\n\n Educate | The computer screen is also useful as a teaching aid. With a click of the mouse, information such as a patient's weight, blood pressure, and blood glucose measurements can be shown as a histogram and become the basis for a conversation either reinforcing good health habits or talking about how to improve them.\n\n Debrief | Do not take for granted that instructions to patients are clear and perfectly understood. Examination room computers provide the perfect opportunity to use a \"teach back\" or a \"talk back\" format to assess the degree to which recommendations are understood. Being POISED for examination room computer use need not cost additional visit time. Used well, just the opposite is true. Medicine is fundamentally a human enterprise that is still practiced one conversation at a time. The study by Ratanawongsa et al 2 reminds us that our most vulnerable patients may be at even greater risk than others when a disproportionate amount of a physician's time is spent interacting with the computer screen and not with the patient. It is said that technology is neither good nor bad, but it is not neutral. Our challenge is to find the best ways to incorporate computers in the examination room without losing the heart and soul of medicine: the physician-patient relationship.\n\n Richard M.

[13] also showed that only 2 % (4/199) and 6 % (12/198) of the patients developed GIST recurrence while receiving adjuvant imatinib for 12 and 36 months, respectively, compared with 40 % of patients treated with surgery alone (historical controls with a median follow-up of 24 months) [14] . These results suggest that acquired resistance to adjuvant imatinib was infrequent, especially since both arms included patients with mutations known to be less sensitive or resistant to imatinib (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha [PDGFRA] D842V) [13] .\n\n In a case report, Kang [15] described a patient who was at high risk of recurrence (after undergoing complete resection of a primary GIST) and received 2 years of imatinib therapy. Ten months after completion of the adjuvant treatment, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed disease recurrence. The patient was re-treated with imatinib 400 mg/day and, 1 month later, a PR was observed (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) with a 43 % decrease in tumor size and mild AEs (grade 1 edema, anemia, and fatigue). The PR was maintained for 33 months before the disease progressed again. The patient was then treated with a dose escalation to 800 mg/day and was still being monitored at the time of publication.\n\n Overall, these results suggest that sensitivity to imatinib is not compromised by prior exposure to adjuvant imatinib and that imatinib reintroduction remains an option for patients who experience GIST recurrence after completing the recommended adjuvant treatment ( Table 2) .\n\n Although imatinib is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication, the NCCN mentions that imatinib may be used as neoadjuvant prior to surgery to downstage a tumor and improve the probability of R0 resection and/or reduce morbidity (Fig. 1) [1] . Many investigations have shown the benefits of perioperative imatinib. In a study of 29 patients who received neoadjuvant imatinib (median duration, 8.5 months) for borderline resectable and locally advanced GIST, the overall response rate was 79.3 %: 62.5 % of the patients initially deemed to have unresectable GIST underwent surgery and 90.5 % of those originally scheduled for surgery had a less extensive one [16] . Following resection, 86.2 % of patients received adjuvant imatinib and, after a mean follow-up of 10 months, locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis were found in one (4 %) and two (8 %) patients, respectively [16] .\n\n In another study, 19 patients with locally advanced GIST received neoadjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for \u226512 weeks (up to 6 months in cases of suboptimal response). Treatment was stopped 5-7 days prior to surgery and resumed afterward for 2 years (or until response) [17] . Preoperative imatinib allowed 68.4 % of the patients to achieve PR with R0 resection, whereas 31.6 % achieved SD with R1 resection. At a 2-year follow-up, there was no PD or death, and AEs were minimal [17] . Similarly, Jakob et al. followed up 36 patients with primary rectal GIST who underwent surgery in the context of neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant imatinib [18] . Results showed that the patients treated with perioperative imatinib had improved disease-free survival (DFS; p<0.01) and OS (p=0.03).
