Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Often, a small amount of pressure support is added to these breaths to overcome the resistive load of the ETT and augment V T . The V T achieved with these breaths is not controlled by the clinician but rather a function of patient effort and respiratory system mechanics. Use of SIMV in a spontaneously breathing patient often results in two unique ventilator waveforms: supported mandatory breaths and spontaneous pressure-supported breaths. In patients without spontaneous efforts (eg, because of neuromuscular blockade), SIMV is identical to AC, as the patient will receive only time triggered machine breaths.\n\n SIMV has been purported to reduce respiratory muscle disuse atrophy, improve ventilator synchrony, and prevent respiratory alkalosis 14 ; however, in patients whose spontaneous RR is significantly higher than the set IMV rate, SIMV may promote respiratory muscle fatigue. 15 Although there is a lack of convincing evidence to support or discourage the use of SIMV as the primary mode of mechanical ventilation in acutely ill patients, several well-conducted trials have found SIMV inferior to other methods during ventilator weaning. With each breath, a set inspiratory pressure is delivered above positive end-expiratory pressure. Per the equation of motion, constant pressure waveforms require decelerating inspiratory flow, and when this inspiratory flow falls to a preset percentage of peak inspiratory flow (solid arrow), the machine cycles off. Tidal volume will vary based on respiratory system mechanics and patient effort. (B) Pressure, volume, and time waveforms in SIMV-VC with pressure support. Flow-targeted volume-cycled mandatory breaths are given at a rate set by the clinician (gray box). These breaths are \"synchronized\" to patient effort (and thereby assisted) if a patient attempts to trigger a breath near the time of set breath delivery (gray circle). Between synchronized and mandatory breaths, the patient may take spontaneous breaths which are generally supported with pressure support (middle two breaths). SIMV-VC, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation-volume controlled.\n\n Initial ventilator settings for patients placed on invasive mechanical ventilation should be guided by the cause of respiratory failure, the goals of mechanical ventilation, and the patient's comorbidities. In general, ventilation is manipulated by changes in V T and RR. To improve oxygenation, FiO 2 and/or PEEP can be increased. PEEP improves oxygenation by recruiting collapsed alveoli and decreasing intrapulmonary shunt. 18 Below, we provide an overview of ventilator strategies for three common scenarios encountered in clinical practice.\n\n Some patients who require mechanical ventilation will have a normal minute ventilation (\u22486-8 L/min). These include patients intubated for upper airway obstruction (eg, angioedema), altered mental status (eg, ethanol intoxication), and those undergoing surgery. In these cases, the following settings are likely to achieve an adequate PaO 2 (eg, PaO 2 60-80 mm Hg, SpO 2 >88%) and acceptable PaCO 2 (eg, 30-50 mm Hg) in most adult patients: \n\n For patients with ARDS, a ventilator strategy that prioritizes lowtidal volumes and low plateau pressures, termed \"lung protective ventilation,\" has been shown to improve mortality. 5 Reasonable initial settings for a patient with ARDS include the following: Note the higher initial RR that is needed to match the high minute ventilation of patients with ARDS. The V T should be decreased over several hours to a goal of 6 mL/kg IBW. The RR is increased in parallel with the decrease in V T to maintain an adequate minute ventilation and avoid progressive hypercapnia and acidemia. Tidal volume should be decreased further if necessary to achieve a P plt <30 cm H 2 O. PEEP and FiO 2 are adjusted in stepwise fashion to maintain a PaO 2 of 55-80 mm Hg. 5 \n\n For patients with status asthmaticus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ventilation should allow for complete exhalation to prevent the development of auto-PEEP (discussed further below). This is most effectively accomplished by limiting RR and V T . 10 Reasonable initial settings include the following: For patients with severe bronchospasm, clinicians should target a minute ventilation of 6 to 8 L/minute to prevent auto-PEEP. Deep sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents may be required to achieve this goal. 10 Elevations in PaCO 2 are tolerated to facilitate the reduction in minute ventilation provided the pH does not drop below 7.15.

We include it here because it was based on the largest ever sample for an HIV treatment RCT in the cART era and aimed to assess cART prevention of HAND. HIV? therapy-na\u00efve adults (N = 250) were randomized to either AZT-lamivudine-nevirapine or tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment determined that all were neurocognitively normal as per Frascati criteria using the GDS method. This is an important point given the primary study aim to assess incident neurocognitive impairment; if the authors had used a short battery (adopting the rationale that some domains should not be tested) or determined neurological status based on clinical grounds, reliability in the determination of this outcome would have been substantially weakened. Using standard regression-based change scores derived from a demographically comparable control group (methods that control for practice effects and regression towards the mean but add historical bias in an RCT), the authors found incident impairment at 96 weeks was greater in the tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz arm than in the other arm. However, a higher proportion of adverse events were noted in the AZT-lamivudine-nevirapine arm. These results support the rationale that not all antiretroviral regimens are equivalent for preventing HAND. CNS and peripheral toxicity cannot be excluded as a potential confounding factor while viral suppression was equivalent between regimens. In the anticipated publication, it would be important for the authors to detail the trajectories of individuals according to their baseline performance and whether particular neurocognitive functions were associated with decline in the efavirenz arm. Nonetheless, the study represents a strong proof-of-concept for larger implementation.\n\n Decloedt and Maartens [105] note that ''several mechanisms exist to explain the observed efavirenz neurotoxicity, including altered calcium hemostasis, decreases in brain creatine kinase, mitochondrial damage, increases in brain proinflammatory cytokines and involvement of the cannabinoid system.'' Moreover, another mechanism has recently been proposed which could have important implications for aging HIV? persons. Indeed, Brown et al. [109] have found in a murine model (murine N2a cells transfected with the human ''Swedish'' mutant form of amyloid precursor protein) that efavirenz promotes b-secretase expression and increased Ab1-40,42 via oxidative stress and reduced microglial phagocytosis. While preliminary, this finding suggests that some efavirenz effects could be long term, potentially explaining the conflicting research findings to date relating to the drug [104] .\n\n Maraviroc has good CSF penetration as well as anti-neuroinflammatory properties [110] [111] [112] [113] . Preliminary data supporting a potential neurocognitive benefit of a maraviroc-intensified regimen were reported in a sub-analysis of a recent single-arm, open-label pilot study. A small subset (n = 6) of HIV? participants with mild to moderate global neurocognitive impairment improved over 24 weeks [114] . In a slightly larger prospective, double observer-blinded, open-label pilot RCT [115] (all established HAND cases, virally suppressed in plasma and CSF: n = 9 maravirocintensified arm and n = 5 existing regimen control arm; assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months on a five-cognitive domain battery), we found medium to large effect sizes favoring improved global neurocognitive performance in the maraviroc-intensified arm over time (after correcting for practice effects and using adaptive randomization for HIV factors and mild co-morbidities). Both studies support the need for larger RCTs.\n\n Recently, several European observational studies have investigated whether protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy/dual therapy differs from more traditional triple therapy in terms of neurocognitive outcomes [116] [117] [118] given they could be considered as alternative regimens (lower cost, less toxicity) in patients with chronic HIV infection who are otherwise well-controlled if they have sufficiently high genetic barriers to resistance [119] .", "qa": [["45_1239610_10_1", "What are some potential mechanisms that could explain the observed neurotoxicity of efavirenz?\n", "According to Decloedt and Maartens, some potential mechanisms that could explain the observed neurotoxicity of efavirenz include altered calcium hemostasis, decreases in brain creatine kinase, mitochondrial damage, increases in brain proinflammatory cytokines, and involvement of the cannabinoid system.

It accounts for about 2% of childhood cancers in the US. Approximately 800 new cases are diagnosed in the US every year, about 400 of which are in children and teens [1] . OS occurs mostly between the ages of 10 and 30. Approximately 60% of all malignant bone tumors diagnosed in the first two decades of life are osteosarcomas.\n\n The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is well established in the treatment of osteosarcoma [2, 3] . Prior to use of systemic chemotherapy, two-year survival was less than 20% even in patients with clinically localized disease. Most recent studies report a 3-year survival of 60-70% among patients with non-metastatic disease treated with combination chemotherapy. Standard treatment for non-metastatic osteosarcoma includes neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and post-operative chemotherapy. The extent of necrosis of the primary tumor at time of definitive surgical resection is the only significant prognostic factor in patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. Patients with less than 10% viable tumor at time of definitive surgery have significantly lower risk of relapse as compared to those with more than 10% viable tumor [4] . Five-year survival is 75-80% among patients with good histological response and only 45-55% among poor responders even after complete surgical resection [5, 6] .\n\n The most active chemotherapeutic agents against osteosarcoma include cisplatin, doxorubicin and high dose methotrexate. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) considers combination cisplatin, doxorubicin and high dose methotrexate (MAP) as standard therapy for osteosarcoma [7] . Postoperative therapy is often modified in poor responders to improve outcome, such as the use of ifosfamide and etoposide [8] [9] [10] . However, no such attempts have been successful to date. It is likely that the initial 8-12 weeks of ineffective therapy select for resistant clones and allow the cancer cells to metastasize. Changing therapy at a later time point fails to change the outcome. There is a need to identify the poor responders at time of initial diagnosis to avoid delivering ineffective pre-operative therapy. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents at initial diagnosis could potentially alter outcomes in patients expected to have poor response to standard cisplatin based chemotherapy. Thus, the key challenge is to determine the basis for response and non-response in patients at the outset and identify patients who are eligible for intensified or alternative therapy given their personal profile.\n\n The completion of the HapMap project is a historic achievement [11] . The project identified over one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the human genome, which may be at the root of the great variation seen in human health and disease. Germline genetic variation between individuals may lie at the heart of two critical questions: who is at risk to develop cancer, and how best to treat individuals once they are diagnosed. This genetic variation may account for the wide variation seen in the response and toxicity related to chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n The pharmacogenetic differences between patients are multi-factorial [12] . One factor is polymorphism in drug targets, including cell surface receptors and target proteins. Another is polymorphism in cellular recovery mechanisms that repair cytotoxic agent-induced damage. Finally, there are polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in drug pharmacokinetics, including proteins that impact drug absorption, metabolism, distribution, and elimination (ADME). Germline pharmacogenetic biomarkers have been found for a number of anticancer agents, including irinotecan, mercaptopurine, 5-flurouracil, and tamoxifen [13] [14] [15] [16] . These studies often used a candidate gene approach, and attempted to explain a drug's efficacy or toxicity by identifying one gene and even one variant within that gene [17] .\n\n While candidate gene/single variant analysis provides important insights, there are several limitations in most published studies. The implicated alleles were often low frequency and the absolute numbers of patients with these alleles were low. Only one or few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined for each gene of interest and potentially significant polymorphisms could have been missed. In this study, we applied both single SNP and multiple SNP analysis to get an enhanced understanding of genetic polymorphism in the disease.\n\n A genome-wide approach enables examination of polymorphisms of a large number of implicated genes in multiple pathways that may impact on response to chemotherapy.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis Schandelmaier et al. studied the effectiveness of RTW coordination, conducted either by a RTW-coordinator or a team coordinating services and communication between the stakeholders involved. Based on nine randomized controlled trials (RCT's) they concluded that there is moderate quality evidence that RTW coordination interventions result in small relative increases in RTW [12] .\n\n Some studies have pointed out that implementing interventions with several interactive elements may be subject to reinvention and implementation failures [22] [23] [24] , potentially reducing intervention effects. For example, a detailed evaluation of the intervention project 'the Danish RTW-programme' , which among other aspects introduced interdisciplinary RTW teams, showed large variations between municipalities for most implementation aspects [25] . Large variations in the implementation were also found in an intervention focussing on improvements of sickness benefit management for beneficiaries with mental health problems [26] . Among the barriers for implementation were stakeholders' different interpretations of sickness absence legislation, competing rehabilitation alternatives and lack of managerial support for the intervention, while the motivation and availability of resources to solve disagreement through extensive communication was an important facilitator for the implementation. Overall, the study found delayed RTW compared to ordinary case management [27] and in a comprehensive process evaluation the authors identified a number of implementation failures [28] .\n\n In this article we present results from a three-year multidimensional public-private partnership intervention focussing on improving the quality and efficiency of sickness benefit case management in six Danish municipalities. Within the Danish system, municipal social insurance officers (SIOs) are responsible for case management of sickness absence beneficiaries, including coordinating RTW activities with relevant stakeholders, such as employers and health professionals. Municipalities can design and implement their own sickness benefit management policies and procedures within the framework of the sickness benefit act. The intervention, which was provided by the six municipalities in cooperation with the private company Falck Health Care (Falck), consisted of various elements. For example measures that enabled SIOs to work more efficiently (e.g. increased resources and improved tools for documentation and case management) and more structured (e.g. introduction of uniform case management standards). Another element consisted in strengthening the competencies for guiding sick-listed individuals through their long-term sickness absence (e.g. further education courses on a variety of topics in relation to sickness benefit management).\n\n The aim of the intervention was, through the improvement in the quality and efficiency of sickness benefit case management, to support a faster RTW, i.e. to reduce the duration of sickness benefit spells, especially the long-lasting ones (exceeding 52 weeks). To test if the intervention achieved a faster RTW we measured two outcomes: the sickness benefit duration (primary outcome) and the time until self-support (secondary outcome).\n\n For both outcomes we also tested if there was a distinct effect for spells exceeding 52 weeks.\n\n \n\n We used a difference-in-difference (DID) design to measure the intervention effect: we compared the before-after development in the sickness benefit duration and time to self-support in six intervention municipalities with the before-after development in 12 control municipalities. The study period consisted of a pre-intervention period and a post-initiation period. The pre-intervention period was about four years in all the intervention municipalities. The post-initiation period lasted from the initiation of the intervention (ranging from August 2008 to September 2009 across the six intervention municipalities) through February 2013 when our study period ended. Consequently, the length of the post-initiation period varied between 42 and 55 months across the municipalities depending on the initiation date. We used similar study periods for the control municipalities.\n\n In Denmark municipalities administer the national sickness benefit act, which covers wage earners, the selfemployed and unemployed persons in the unemployment insurance scheme. Over the past decade the sickness benefit scheme has undergone a number of reforms and changes [29] , with further changes implemented in 2014. Here we describe the stipulations effective during the study period: sick-listed can receive sickness benefits for up to 52 weeks. The first weeks of sickness benefits for employees are financed by the employer. The duration of this employer financed period has been two weeks until 2008, three weeks until 2012 and has since been four weeks. After the employer financed period sickness benefits are financed by the municipalities and the state. The benefit period can be prolonged under certain conditions, e.g. if vocational rehabilitation may help the sick-listed become fit for work.\n\n The municipal SIO must perform a sickness benefit case management interview with all sick-listed within eight weeks after the first day of sick leave.", "qa": [["40_17754230_0_1", "What are some potential barriers to the implementation of interventions aimed at improving sickness benefit case management?\n", "Some potential barriers to the implementation of interventions aimed at improving sickness benefit case management include stakeholders' different interpretations of sickness absence legislation, competing rehabilitation alternatives, and lack of managerial support for the intervention.

However, repacking of a drug which is sold to another hospital, whether or not such other hospital is under the control of the same corporation, would require registration under Section 510.\"\n\n It is standard practice in today's long-term care environment for pharmacists to prepackage medications from the manufacturer's original packaging into unit dose blister cards for residents of long-term care facilities. The practice of providing specialized or compliance packaging has been a hallmark of long-term care pharmacy practice to help reduce medication administration errors and assist facility and pharmacy staff in identifying drug diversion. This practice was recently recognized by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as one of ten service and performance criteria that is commonly provided by long-term care pharmacy.\n\n Accordingly, the boards of pharmacy in many states, including Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, and Nevada, have developed prepackaging regulations that specify labeling and recordkeeping requirements. The LTC Task Force members, recognizing that prepackaging activities are a common occurrence, suggested that the Model Act incorporate specific regulatory guidance for this activity.\n\n \u2022 By creating a definition under the Model Rules for Pharmaceutical Care for \"prepackaging,\" NABP distinguished \"prepackaging\" from \"repackaging,\" and clarified that repackaging medications previously dispensed by another pharmacy is considered manufacturing.\n\n Background: NABP's Model Act allows pharmacists to provide medication therapy management services as an element of pharmacist care. 1 Under the Model Act, medication therapy management services are intended to optimize therapeutic outcomes for patients and may include:\n\n (1) Performing or obtaining necessary assessments of the patient's health status; (3) Selecting, initiating, modifying, or administering medication therapy; (4) Monitoring and evaluating the patient's response to therapy, including safety and effectiveness; (5) Performing a comprehensive medication review to identify, resolve, and prevent medication-related problems, including adverse drug events; (6) Documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to the patient's other primary care providers; (7) Providing verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and appropriate use of his/her medications; (8) Providing information, support services and resources designed to enhance patient adherence with his/her therapeutic regimens; (9) Coordinating and integrating Medication Therapy Management services within the broader health care-management services being provided to the patient; and (10) Such other patient care services as may be allowed by law.\n\n The NABP Model Act recognizes that certain Medication Therapy Management Services may need to be performed within the confines of a collaborative practice agreement or formulary system managed by a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee within an institutional setting. These services can prove invaluable to patient care. In long-term care settings, collaborative agreements or formulary systems that allow pharmacists to select, initiate, and/or modify medication therapy can be particularly beneficial.\n\n It is important to differentiate medication therapy management services from medication regimen review services in the long-term care setting, which are mandated as a component of a broad range of nursing facility regulations in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) State Operations Manual (SOM).\n\n \u2022 NABP encourages state boards of pharmacy to review and seek revision of statutes or rules to strengthen legislation for pharmacist involvement in medication therapy management services, including those that allow pharmacists to select, initiate and/or modify medication therapy services pursuant to a collaborative practice agreement with a prescriber.\n\n Background: NABP's Telepharmacy Task Force developed a framework for the provision of remote pharmacy services while considering current regulatory and patient safety standards, allowable scope of practice, the use of pharmacy support personnel, and maintenance of quality assurance procedures. The Telepharmacy Task Force developed these recommendations recognizing the national pharmacist shortage and the potential to effectively provide pharmacist care services using electronic technologies to patients at a distance.\n\n \u2022 NABP added to the Model Act definitions of \"remote pharmacy,\" \"remote dispensing site,\" and \"coordinating pharmacy\" to provide the basic framework for the provision of remote pharmacy services. A \"remote pharmacy\" is a \"pharmacy staffed by a pharmacist, pharmacy intern, or certified pharmacy technician that is electronically linked to the coordinating pharmacy via a computer system and/or a video/auditory communication system approved by the board.\" A \"remote dispensing site\" is a site located within an institutional facility or a clinic that utilizes an automated pharmacy system and that is electronically linked to the coordinating pharmacy via a computer system and/or a video/auditory communication system approved by the Board. A \"coordinating pharmacy\" is a pharmacy responsible for the practice of telepharmacy performed at Remote Pharmacies and Remote Dispensing Sites.\" \u2022 The Model Act was amended to add regulations addressing the registration/licensure of the primary and remote sites (coordinating pharmacy, remote pharmacy, and remote dispensing site), remote site personnel, remote patient counseling, the use of automated dispensing technologies, security, policies and procedure maintenance, quality assurance, recordkeeping, and the restriction of remote sites to areas or communities that are underserved.\n\n The NABP and ASCP recommend that the seven practice issues addressed in this Report be reviewed and adopted as appropriate by state boards of pharmacy. Pharmacists must understand the impact of these changes and collaborate with state boards of pharmacy to update state pharmacy practice acts to ensure the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the public.

Herbal drugs constitute a major share among all the officially recognized systems of healthcare in India such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. These systems have rightfully existed sideby-side with Allopathy and are not in 'the domain of obscurity' (Vaidya and Devasagayam, 2007; Subramanian et al., 2003) . These systems are not folklore or traditional herbal practices, but are basic axioms that serves as a determinant of therapy (Vaidya, 1992; and Vaidya and Devasagayam, 2007) . A majority of medicines are being prepared from the plants products in India with major Pharmaceutical industries producing excellent herbal drug preparations in both forms i.e., nutraceutical and therapeutics. Some of the important Herbal Pharma industries actively engaged in herbal preparations can be quoted as, Gurukula Kangri Pharmacy (Haridwar), Dabur, Himalaya, Charak, Hamdard, Baidyanath, Zandu etc. There is a vast literature on Ayurveda available in different languages i.e., Hindi, Sanskrit and several regional languages along with English.

There are many references to Indian medicinal plants and spices in a number of historical documents. For instance, Indian Aloe is very widely used for cosmetic, medicinal and nutraceutical purpose in India (Srivastava and Singh, 1996) . Despite the global reputation of Aloe in dermatocosmetics, the potential as antiaging is still untapped (Raina, 1996) . Similarly, the plant Adhatoda vasica has been extensively studied for cough (Shah and Chauhan, 1996) but its role in the bleeding disorders and tuberculosis still needs significant research.Indian medicinal plants are also a vast source of antioxidants (Vaidya and Devasagayam, 2007) . There are ayurvedic formulations containing ingredients from medicinal plants with antioxidant activities. Some of these are Amrita bindu, Centalaplus, Chapparal, Geriforte, Jigrine, Liv-52, Ophtacare, P55A, Sandhika and Tamra bhasma. Recently Singh and Lal (2008) carried out ethnobotanical survey in 130 localities of Lahaul-Spiti region in Western himalaya and reported several plants used by the native traditional practitioners in herbal formulations as a remedy to cure rheumatism, liver and stomach disorders, and various sexual ailments. These include Aconitum heterophyllum (root and leaf; stomach disorders), Aconitum rotundifolium (root; liver disorders and rheumatism), Aphragmus oxycarpus (aerial parts; sexual dysfunction), Artemisia maritime (root and seed; stomach disorders and rheumatism), Bupleurum falcatum (aerial parts; stomach disorders), Capparis spinosa (shoot and flower; liver disorder and sexual dysfunction), Carum carvi (seed; sexual dysfunction and liver disorder), Crepis flexuosa (whole part; liver disorder), Ephedra regeliana (leaf and fruit; rheumatism), Erigeron borealis (leaf; stomach disorder), Gentiana moorcroftiana (aerial part; liver disorder), Gentianopsis detonsa (leaf and flower; liver disorder), Geranium pretense (whole part; liver and stomach disorder), Heracleum lanatum (root and leaf; stomach disorder and rheumatism), Hippophae tibetana (flower; sexual dysfunction and liver disorder), Lactuca rapunculoides (leaf; stomach disorder), Lepidium latifolium (leaf and flower; rheumatism), Plantago major (seed; stomach disorder), Polygonum tortuosum (aerial part; liver and stomach disorders), Rosa webbiana (flower; sexual dysfunction and liver disorders), and Scorzonera divaricata (leaf and shoot; stomach and liver disorders).\n\n There are still a large number of plants and Ayurvedic formulations whose activities need to be examined in relation to their potential therapeutic and related beneficial properties.

Second, in addition to neoplastic cells, the sample may contain both small and large reactive lymphocytes. Merely counting the number of large cells may overestimate or underestimate the number of large cells in the neoplastic population. Third, many of the transformed lymphomas may have variable numbers of cells in the process of transformation. These cells are often intermediate in size. Evaluation of these cells by CM examination can be problematic. These disadvantages can be largely overcome by the concomitant use of FC analysis. In FC analysis, cells are processed in suspension and are less influenced by mechanical factors. The coexisting nonneoplastic lymphocytes can be eliminated by gating and analyzing the monoclonal or abnormal populations. The cell size is more accurately determined by using a forward scatter histogram. Last, FC analysis has the ability to analyze a large number of cells, facilitating more accurate interpretation. However, it also is recognized that large cells often are underrepresented in FC analysis owing to low viability, and a substantial proportion of large B-cell lymphomas may have falsenegative or nondiagnostic FC results. 22, 25 We attempted to use a combined CM and FC method to evaluate large cells in NHL. All cases in the present study had cytologic preparations, adequate flow cytometric analysis of the same specimen, and subsequent surgical biopsy at the same site. Our data showed that only DLBCLs had more than 40% large cells by both CM and FC methods and that none of the small cell NHLs showed more than 40% large cells. Hence, we suggest using a minimum large cell percentage of 40% in the diagnosis of DLBCL. In the assessment of small cell NHLs, FC analysis seemed to be more sensitive than CM examination. All small cell NHLs had 20% or fewer large cells by FC analysis, whereas by CM examination, 13 (81%) of 16 small cell NHLs showed fewer than 20% large cells. Based on these results, we believe that fewer than 20% large cells are required to exclude DLBCL using both FNA CM and FC analyses. Compared with the study by Young et al, 20 our study showed a slightly higher percentage of large cells in the diagnosis of both large cell lymphoma and small cell NHL. This is perhaps because of the different methods and classification systems used in the studies. Nevertheless, while none of the small cell NHLs in our study showed between 20% and 40% large cells by FC analysis, 3 cases (19%) of the small cell NHLs had large cell counts between 20% and 40% by CM examination. We believe interpretation should be cautious in this range, and further study may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n Burkitt lymphoma is a rapidly proliferating, highly aggressive malignant lymphoma and requires early therapeutic intervention. We found cell size determination by CM and FC analyses was useful in the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. In addition to the characteristic morphologic features, both CM and FC analyses disclosed more than 90% intermediate-sized cells in all cases studied. However, owing to the small number of cases (4 cases) included in this series, evaluation of larger numbers of cases is necessary to confirm these findings.\n\n FNA evaluation of grade III follicular lymphoma and low-grade lymphoma with partial large cell transformation is less reliable. In these 2 categories, there were variable numbers of large cells (ranging from 11.2% to 79.5% by FC analysis and 15.5% to 71.0% by CM examination). Approximately one third of the cases showed fewer than 40% large cells. These results correlated with the histologic findings in which wide ranges of large cells were observed. Similar issues were addressed by Dong and colleagues, 13 who found it difficult to distinguish some of the DLBCL cases from grade III follicular lymphomas by FNA. The presence of these categories complicated the issue of FNA evaluation of large cells.", "qa": [["35_30569765_3_1", "How does the concomitant use of flow cytometry (FC) analysis overcome the disadvantages of evaluating large cells based on cytomorphology (CM) features alone in lymphomas?", "The concomitant use of FC analysis in evaluating large cells in lymphomas overcomes the disadvantages of CM evaluation by processing cells in suspension, reducing the influence of mechanical factors.

This point has implications for treatment decisions, as particular subtypes of PTD, such as inflammatory-induced versus adjustment-based, may be more or less responsive to pharmacological versus behavioral interventions.\n\n Age, 8, 15 race, 8, 86 less independence in functional tasks after injury, 11, 15, [87] [88] [89] engaging in maladaptive coping, 90, 91 and sleep disturbance or fatigue 46, 92, 93 were all associated with PTD. Furthermore, being unemployed or impoverished at the time of injury or substance abuse before or at the time of injury also conferred a higher likelihood of developing PTD. 8, 12, 13, 15, 94 Personality characteristics and pre-injury psychiatric conditions that increase the risk of sustaining a TBI 95, 96 may also put individuals at greater risk for developing PTD. 7, 85, 94 In fact, one of the biggest predictors of PTD was a pre-injury history of depression or other psychiatric disorder. 7, 94, 97 However, the extent to which pre-injury mental health conditions contribute to PTD development through biological versus psychological pathways is unknown.\n\n The appraisal of post-injury abilities compared to the appraisal of pre-injury abilities was another underlying factor related directly to the adjustment to disability that contributes significantly to the development of psychiatric disorders after TBI. 87, [98] [99] [100] [101] Individuals with TBI often overgeneralize the effects their injuries have on their abilities and daily lives. 102, 103 These perceptions were strongly influenced by the individual's ability or failure to attain post-injury goals. 104, 105 Individuals with cognitive impairment may have difficulty engaging in goal-directed, problem-solving behavior, [106] [107] [108] resulting in poor goal attainment and contributing to PTD. Individuals with TBI engaged less frequently in goal-directed problem-solving than individuals without injuries, 109 often as a result of associated impairments in executive functions. 90, 110 Individuals who do engage in goal-directed problem-solving post-injury had higher selfefficacy, less perceived stress, less depression and anxiety, and overall better psychosocial functioning than those who engage in wishful thinking or avoidance behaviors after injury. 90, 102, 109, 111 Therefore, goal-directed and problemsolving behaviors may represent one effective avenue of treatment for PTD.\n\n A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to examine the evidence for efficacious interventions to address PTD, with very limited evidence supporting any approach. 27, 101, [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] In addition to (and perhaps partly as a result of) the lack of clear recommendations and guidelines for treating PTD, studies have suggested that a relatively high proportion of individuals living in the community received limited or no treatment for PTD. 3, 119 Given the long-term consequences of PTD, research to establish evidence-based rehabilitation interventions for depression should be a high priority in rehabilitation research. [120] [121] [122] Increasing priority should also be given to investigating personalized treatment approaches based on factors ranging from genetic variation to mental health history. Rehabilomics is a rehabilitationcentered conceptual framework that adapts the World Health Organization's International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health to outline a personalized biopsychosocial approach to rehabilitation research and care, [123] [124] [125] [126] and it could serve as a contemporary framework from which to conduct innovative and effective research into personalized risk assessment and personalized rehabilitation interventions, where treatment assignment is delineated based on personal biology and other individual factors hypothesized to contribute to PTD.\n\n The current literature does not support any gold standard for PTD treatment.

Industry spent more than $5 billion on these ads in 2007 (1)-more than twice the total U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) budget (2) . Although the ads are often justified as serving an educational purpose, they generally fail to provide the most fundamental information consumers need to make informed decisions: data on how well the drug works.\n\n To address this problem, we developed a \"drug facts box,\" a 1-page summary of a drug's benefit and side effects. The central information is provided in a table that shows the chance of various outcomes for people who do and do not take the drug. In previous studies, we showed that consumers understand and value this information (3, 4) .\n\n We performed 2 randomized, controlled trials in nationally representative samples of U.S. adults (the target audience for direct-to-consumer advertising) to test whether a drug facts box improves consumer knowledge and helps people make better choices.\n\n the symptom drug box trial and the prevention drug box trial. We conducted a pair of trials because consumers generally face decisions about 2 categories of drugs: those taken to treat current symptoms and those taken to reduce the risk for future events (prevention). In the symptom drug box trial, we used direct-to-consumer ads for drugs to treat heartburn, an outcome (heartburn relief) that is common and experienced directly. We chose to include a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and a histamine-2 (H 2 )-blocker because both drugs are used to treat current symptoms of the same disease and have similar side effect profiles, but PPIs clearly outperform H 2 -blockers; we could therefore assess whether the box helped consumers choose the superior drug. In the prevention drug box trial, we used advertisements for a statin and clopidogrel for secondary cardiovascular prevention. These drugs are used to reduce the risk for future events that are important but relatively rare (heart attack and death), so absolute effects can only be small. The goal of this trial was to see whether the box improved the accuracy of consumers' perceptions about drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk. Figure 1 shows the ads used in each trial.\n\n Committees for the protection of human subjects at Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Massachusetts approved the trials. Trial protocols were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov before recruitment began.\n\n Figure 2 summarizes participant flow into the study.\n\n The Center for Survey Research, University of Massachusetts (who conducted both surveys), created 2 national, randomdigit dial samples, each with about 3000 telephone numbers.\n\n Trained interviewers used a standard protocol in which they called each telephone number at least 6 times (different days, weeks, and times).

Participants were not told about the alternate survey form. Nonresponders received reminder postcards after 2 weeks, a replacement questionnaire after 4 weeks, a telephone call after 6 weeks, and a questionnaire after 8 weeks.\n\n We used standard Association for Public Opinion Research methods to calculate overall response rates (5).

During each test-run, ventilator settings were maintained unchanged; only the fresh-gas percentage (FGC) or the set end-tidal percentage (AC) of volatile anaesthetic were adjusted.\n\n As summarized in Table 2 , using the Zeus \u00d2 apparatus, five different settings were used for each agent (sevoflurane and desflurane): FGC 1 litre FGF; FGC 6 litre FGF; AC 1 litre FGF; AC 6 litre FGF; and AC uptake mode, in which FGF equals consumption. Using the Primus \u00d2 apparatus, only the two FGC modes were used. In FGC, the anaesthetist manually titrated the vaporizer towards the targeted level. This was done by first setting the vaporizer at a maximum Closed-circuit vs conventional anaesthesia machine concentration (8% for sevoflurane and 18% for desflurane) until the target end-tidal inhaled anaesthetic concentration was reached. Vaporizer settings were then titrated in step changes of 0.3-0.5 vol % in order to maintain the targeted end-tidal inhaled anaesthetic concentration. In AC mode (Zeus \u00d2 only), drug administration needed to reach and maintain the targeted end-tidal concentration was performed automatically.

Therefore, overweight in the elderly is an important public health issue in Japan.\n\n Many studies reported high serum total cholesterol (TC) to pose a higher risk of coronary heart diseases than other measures of dyslipidemia. [3] [4] [5] Although numerous cross-sectional studies have established that overweight and obesity are risk factors for high TC, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] the longitudinal change of the associations is controversial. 10, 11 For example, a cross-sectional study showed the odd ratios (ORs) for high TC (overweight vs normal) were 1.5 and 1.9 among men and women, respectively. 10 The study targeted American subjects aged 50-76 years at 2000-2002 and defined high TC from self-report data. On the other hand, another survey reported the ORs for high TC (overweight or obesity vs normal) were 0.9 to 1.2. 11 The study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with stratified sampling, multistage, probability cluster design among American women aged \u226555 years at 1988-1994 and defined high TC as measured serum blood lipid levels exceeding 220 mg=dL. Thus, it is unclear whether the change of associations is due to different protocols, such as sampling, high TC definitions, and others, or due to actual change. A unified protocol is needed to conduct a longitudinal analysis.\n\n Limited data have been published on the association between underweight and high TC. 11, 13 A cross-sectional study showed underweight inversely and significantly associated with high TC. 13 Underweight might be a protective factor for high TC, despite a high mortality risk. 14, 15 However, the longitudinal change of the association between underweight and high TC is also unclear. The long-term trends on the impact of overweight and underweight on high TC have not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the trend of association of overweight or underweight with high TC in a Japanese elderly population using the unified national-wide population-based data set in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 .\n\n \n\n We performed a panel data analysis of information from 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 .\n\n The present study used data from the National Integrated Project for Prospective Observation of Non-communicable Disease And Its Trends in the Aged (NIPPON DATA), which is supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan and consists of ongoing cohort studies conducted using the National Survey on Circulatory Disorders (NSCD) and National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS) in 1980, 1990, and 2010.

First, Elenagen, similar to antibodies and other vaccines, and anti-CTLA4, in contrast to conventional therapeutics, does not evoke objective response (i.e. complete + partial response), but produces tumor control better than most other vaccines, antibodies, or anti-CTLA4 (Supplementary Table S3 ). Second, anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies are more effective than other immune-therapeutics, but they however, have more severe side effects (Supplementary Table S3 ). But regarding specifically breast and ovarian cancers, Elenagen efficacy in tumor control is compatible with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1, but have much better safety (Supplementary Table S3 ). During the trial we observed a phenomenon which, to our knowledge, has not been described in clinics before. When patients with breast and ovarian cancer were pretreated with Elenagen, they restored, at least partially, their sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy which they previously failed (Table 5, 6). There are several possible explanations for such effect. First, chemoradiotherapy (e.g., doxorubicin) can enhance anti-p62 immune response by killing tumor cells via immunogenic cell death [21, 39] . Second, it is currently becoming evident that conventional chemo-radiotherapy, besides killing tumor cells directly, can also modulate immune response. For instance, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin can target immunosuppressive regulatory T and myeloid-derived cells, just enhancing immune response. Preconditioning vaccine and CAR-T therapies with these \"chemotherapeutic\" agents is already in clinical use [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, some drugs such as gemcitabine and taxanes can directly stimulate immune system [39] . For instance, a vaccine directed to Her2-expressing mouse mammary tumors was potentiated by doxorubicin and paclitaxel [40] . Accordingly, treatment with doxorubicin after vaccination increased immune response to Her2 vaccine in clinics [41] , and in patients with other tumors, chemotherapy applied after vaccination was more effective than vaccines or chemotherapy alone [42, 43] .\n\n Although Elenagen alone demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a range of solid tumors, in future trials we consider its combination with chemo-radiotherapy. We also believe that Elenagen should be synergistic with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Combining immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) with vaccines targeting specific cancer antigens is an emerging approach [44] . So far, cancer vaccines are mostly failed in clinical trials because immune response they generate was apparently too weak to control tumor growth in patients owing to immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment (e.g., due to activation of immune checkpoints). If so, one may expect that removing immune checkpoint blockade by ICB would enhance vaccine efficiency. Indeed, in preclinical models of cancer ICB significantly enhanced vaccine efficiency [45] [46] . Partially because of these findings, cancer vaccine field demonstrates resurgence [47] , and there are currently several clinical trial of vaccine-ICB combination, e.g. with Prostvac, GVAX, CEA/MUC etc [44] . We believe that p62-encoding DNA vaccine Elenagen is a promising candidate within this booming area of research.\n\n \n\n The clinical trial followed Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

It seems that adequate time is required for saffron to modulate disorders induced by safranal. Subacute toxicity studies showed that saffron could increase survival in rats so that no mortality was observed at dose of 10 mg/kg. Similar to the results of acute toxicity, increasing dose of saffron caused an increase in mortality. This also could be partially related to the increased level of toxic substances in high doses. Our data also indicated that sub-acute IP administration of safranal (0.2 mL/ kg/day) does not show any significant difference in some biochemical parameters such as total cholesterol, serum glucose, serum creatinine, LDH, AST and bilirubin. However, the levels of triglyceride, BUN and ALT showed a significant increase in safranal and co-treatment of saffron aqueous extract (5 and 10 mg/kg), plus safranal significantly improved all toxic effects of safranal on biochemical parameters.\n\n Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) has shown that by the usage of certain standardized constituents instead of whole herbs, valuable efficacy of whole herbs will be missed (22) . The reason is probably that whole herbs work best as body modulator and transformers, especially facilitating the immune system, providing the foundation of the body to begin healing itself (26) . Saffron stigma consists of more than 150 chemicals (27) , some of them possess valuable and beneficial properties and some exhibit undesirable and harmful activities. The consumption of saffron stigma instead of its main components alone, might increase tolerance and modulate abnormalities in the body. In folk medicine, it has been reported that consumption of whole plants or fruits could reduce some adverse effects induced by some constituents, for example, it has been recommended that consumption of Prunus armeniaca whole fruit, could reduce gastric inflammation induced by the P. armeniaca seed (22) . Previous studies have shown that six weeks administration of safranal (0.25 and 0.5 mL/kg/day, orally) in diabetic rats reduces fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels and improves the blood insulin levels significantly, there were no significant changes in the blood SGOT, SGPT and creatinine levels (28) . Moreover the results of our previous study revealed that safranal (0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mL/kg/day, orally) causes sedation, relaxation and reduction in locomotor activity. Decrease in food and water consumption and weight loss were also observed. A significant reduction in some hematological parameters was also demonstrated. Furthermore safranal reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride at all doses and ALP at two higher doses. In addition, safranal (0.5 mL/kg) caused an increase in the levels of LDH and BUN. Histopathological examination indicated that safranal, especially at the dose of 0.5 mL/ Kg caused toxicity in kidneys and lungs (20) . In this study, safranal (0.2 mL/kg) increased the levels of some common markers of liver toxicity such as ALT (SGPT). However, the levels of bilirubin, AST (SGOT) and LDH were not affected by safranal. It may be postulated that safranal causes mild to moderate hepatotoxicity. Saffron plus safranal especially at dose of 10 mg/kg reduced toxicity. The hepato-protective effects of saffron and its active compo-nent, crocin, have been shown previously (29) . Crocin improved toxic effects of diazinon on rat livers through its antioxidative properties. It could be suggested that there are some active components in saffron stigma aqueous extract which have high antioxidant effects and due to the presence of these chemicals, saffron could improve safranal toxic effects on liver, but increasing the dose may decrease beneficial effects. Our results also indicated that safranal (0.2 mL/kg) increased BUN as a predictor of renal insufficiently while the amount of creatinine was unchanged. Renal damage induced by safranal was established previously (20) . Similar to our results, safranal treated rats showed an increase in BUN and no difference in the levels of serum creatinine was observed. Also these observations were confirmed by renal histopathologic damages. Our results also showed that saffron stigma could decrease the elevation of BUN induced by safranal. The protective effects of saffron extracts against renal toxicity have also been reported in some studies (30, 31) .\n\n The results of safranal on lipid profile showed that although TG was increased, the level of total cholesterol was unchanged. The results of a previous study showed that both TG and cholesterol decreased following safranal administration (20) . The inconsistency between this study and our previous research might be due to the differences in route of administration and/or the differences in the safranal doses. The alterations in lipid profile induced by safranal improved with co-administration of saffron. In summary, our results showed that co-administration of saffron aqueous extract and safranal reduces toxic effects of safranal in acute and sub-acute toxicity as evident by the reduction in mortality as well as alleviation of some safranal toxic effects on specific biochemical markers. Furthermore based on the results, it could be recommended that the consumption of saffron as a whole plant exhibits more safety than safranal as an active component.", "qa": [["75_17254348_2_1", "What are the potential toxic effects of safranal and how can they be mitigated?\n", "Safranal, a chemical component of saffron, has been found to have toxic effects on the body.

By 2001, these proportions had increased to 26% and 22%, respectively, with 55% of women and 66% of men being overweight (BMI > 25 kg / m 2 ; Health Survey for England, 2001), reflecting a worldwide trend which is most marked in, but not restricted to, the developed world. Most of us in affluent countries live in a privileged land of plenty where high calorie foods are easily available and in which we have a limited need for exercise. The rising prevalence of obesity in children is of particular concern (Chinn & Rona, 2001) .\n\n Obesity is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, which can be attributed to increased risk of a number of medical conditions (Kopelman, 2000) including type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease, the most common cause of premature mortality in the obese population. Less well known are the associations between obesity and several cancers including breast, endometrial, prostate and bowel cancer (Daling et al ., 2001) . Obesity predisposes to osteoarthritis particularly in the large weight-bearing joints and to respiratory problems including obstructive sleep apnoea. Thus obesity poses an immense and increasing public health burden.\n\n Despite the increase in population obesity described above, it should not be forgotten , in individual people, energy balance is usually very precise. Daily intake of food is highly variable and correlates poorly with energy expenditure, whereas over longer periods body weight is stable in most adults (Edholm, 1977) . In this article, we will explore how appetite and food intake are regulated peripherally by adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, and how these signals are relayed in the hypothalamus (Fig. 1) . We will discuss which of these pathways might be pharmacologically manipulated.\n\n \n\n Almost 50 years ago, Kennedy (1953) postulated that there was a circulating factor, related to or arising from adipose tissue, that regulated the hypothalamic control of food intake to achieve the usual long-term stability of body weight and fat mass. Insulin was the first hormone postulated to be such a factor. The rise in circulating insulin in response to a glucose load is proportional to fat mass, and insulin reaches the CNS via receptor-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier. CNS administration of insulin to rodents, either into the third ventricle or directly into the hypothalamus, causes a reduction in food intake (Baura et al ., 1993) . However, patients with type II diabetes who are commenced on insulin tend to gain rather than lose weight, probably as a result of a loss of the anorexigenic effect of hyperglycaemia and the lipogenic actions of insulin.\n\n In 1994 there was a major breakthrough when the obese ( ob ) gene was identified from examination of naturally occurring mutant ob/ob mice (Zhang et al ., 1994) . The protein encoded by the ob gene was named leptin from the Greek leptos meaning thin, synthesized predominantly in adipose tissue. Circulating leptin levels are directly proportional to adiposity in animals and humans and correlate better with total fat mass than with body weight . Central and peripheral administration of leptin in rodents cause a profound decrease in food intake and weight loss (Friedman & Halaas, 1998) . However it is the central intracerebroventricular (ICV) route that is the more potent, suggesting that leptin's actions are mediated chiefly through the hypothalamus. The ob/ob mouse, completely deficient in leptin, is hyperphagic, hyperinsulinaemic and very obese and the leptin receptor defective db/db mouse has a similar phenotype (Chua et al ., 1996) . Chronic administration of leptin to the ob/ob mouse results in sustained reduction in body weight, and reduced food intake but has no effect on the db/db mouse.\n\n Leptin increases hours after a meal in rodents and after several days of overeating in humans (Kolaczynski et al ., 1996) .\n\n Conversely, leptin levels fall dramatically with fasting. The magnitude of these responses is disproportionate to changes in fat mass, suggesting that leptin may act to stabilize body weight before a major change in weight occurs.", "qa": [["6_27126118_0_1", "What are some of the medical conditions associated with obesity?\n", "Obesity is associated with an increased risk of several medical conditions, including type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, bowel cancer, osteoarthritis, and respiratory problems such as obstructive sleep apnea."], ["6_27126118_0_2", "How is appetite and food intake regulated in the body?\n", "Appetite and food intake are regulated peripherally by adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, and these signals are relayed in the hypothalamus. Hormones such as insulin and leptin play a role in regulating food intake. Insulin, which is released in response to a glucose load, can reduce food intake when administered into the hypothalamus. Leptin, a hormone predominantly synthesized in adipose tissue, decreases food intake and causes weight loss when administered centrally in rodents."], ["6_27126118_0_3", "What is the role of leptin in regulating body weight?\n", "Leptin is a hormone that is directly proportional to adiposity in animals and humans.
