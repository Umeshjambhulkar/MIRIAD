Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

These include the size and design of the bracket base. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The attachment must be able to deliver orthodontic forces, withstand masticatory loads, be esthetic, and be easy to remove at the end of treatment. [4] Bracket bases do not bond chemically to enamel or resin; therefore, efforts have been made to improve mechanical retention. The increasing demand for a more esthetic metal-bonded appliance has led to, among other things, a reduction in the size of the brackets and their bases. [11] However, the smaller retentive area of the bracket base influences bond strength.\n\n Bracket bond strength depends on several factors. This includes the type of bracket retention mechanism, [12] bonding system, and type of enamel conditioner. Bracket base retention mechanisms can be chemical, mechanical, or a combination of both systems. [13] The retention mechanism of mesh pads has been well documented since Newman [14] published his report and the improvement of these variables has been the goal of many research projects. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] A mechanical undercut in the bracket base provides a place for the orthodontic adhesive to extend before polymerization. [4] Retention of most metal brackets is achieved with a fine-brazed mesh. [5, 6] Other bracket bases have a milled undercut or are sandblasted, chemically etched, or sintered with porous metal powder. [4, 5] Studies have indicated that bond failure in enamel-bonded metal brackets with a mechanical interlock and 15 s of acid-etching time [25, 26] occurs at the resin-bracket base interface, within the resin itself, or between the resin and enamel. However, there was relatively more bond failure between the resin and bracket because of stress concentration and defects in the resin film. [5, 25, 26] The need for a bracket with good retentive bonding between the resin and metal base has been the impetus for numerous studies.\n\n Machine integral bases have been reported to be more retentive than foil-mesh bases. [27] On the other hand, brackets with welded mesh have also been reported as being more retentive in tension, whereas metal brackets with integrated bases were more retentive in shear. [28] The effects of sandblasted bracket base mesh surfaces, reduced base surface area, and enamel etched with various acid types have previously been evaluated. Sandblasting and microetching of foil-mesh bases increased the shear bond strength (SBS). [17] An evaluation of the performance of fine-mesh, coarse-mesh, and undercut bracket bases found that the fine-mesh base had higher tensile bond strength than the coarse-mesh base, and both performed better than the undercut base. [29] Additional studies involved the evaluation of a variety of bracket base designs including 60, 80, and 100 gauge (0.093, 0.123, 0.154 inches, respectively) single-mesh bases, a double-mesh base, and integrated metal base. [14] The conclusion was that the bonding agent significantly affected the SBS and that base designs may influence adhesive penetration of the curing light.\n\n There is no clear consensus regarding the effect of bracket base design on SBS when tested under conditions simulating clinical use. There is, therefore, a need for studies to clarify this important issue in clinical orthodontics. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare SBS of four differently designed brackets using conventional macrofilled orthodontic bonding agent.\n\n The null hypothesis of this study was that there is no difference in the SBS of photochemically etched 80-gauge mesh base, microetched Quadra Grip\u2122 base, 80-gauge woven mesh bonding base, and Treadlok design base brackets when bonded with Transbond XT orthodontic bonding agent to human enamel.\n\n One hundred and twenty recently extracted caries-free human first maxillary premolars were collected and immersed in normal saline solution. Prophylactic treatment was performed with pumice paste and rubber cups on the surfaces of the teeth to be bonded. The pumice and water were nonfluoridated. The teeth were randomized into four groups, of thirty teeth each.\n\n Four different types of orthodontic brackets (for maxillary fist premolars) with mechanical interlocking bases were used in this study.

Chemical retention mechanisms involve bonding systems that chemically bond the bracket base to the enamel or resin. Mechanical retention mechanisms involve creating a mechanical undercut in the bracket base to provide a place for the orthodontic adhesive to extend before polymerization. The type of bracket retention mechanism used can affect the bond strength of the bracket."], ["54_79902339_0_3", "How do different bracket base designs and bonding agents affect the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic brackets?\n", "Studies have evaluated the effects of different bracket base designs, including mesh size, base surface area, and enamel etching, on shear bond strength (SBS). Sandblasting and microetching of foil-mesh bases have been found to increase SBS. Fine-mesh bases have been shown to have higher tensile bond strength than coarse-mesh bases. The bonding agent used also significantly affects SBS, and base designs may influence adhesive penetration of the curing light. However, there is no clear consensus on the effect of bracket base design on SBS under conditions simulating clinical use, highlighting the need for further studies in this area."]]}, {"passage_id": "80_5344654_5", "passage": "The fact that most of the active patients were on a cortisol-lowering medication may have prevented finding greater impairment. We had no data on cognitive performance before suffering CS; nevertheless, most of the patients complained about having a poor cognitive performance, mainly memory problems, in comparison to their prior capacities.\n\n WML have been associated with reduced brain volumes and impaired cognitive function (23, 25, 61) , although this was not the case in our study. The Scheltens scale scores did not correlate with cognitive function or brain volume in patients with CS. Most of the literature studies on WML have been performed in older populations, where cognitive decline and brain atrophy are more pronounced. It is possible that the younger age of our patients may have prevented finding any significant correlations; however, a higher degree of WML may be related to poorer cognitive performance and reduced brain volumes when they reach an older age, which, given the cross-sectional nature of this study, could not be evaluated.\n\n In fact, even if we did not find correlations between WML and cognitive function, WML are known to predispose to dementia, stroke and cognitive decline in old age (23, 25) . This is a key finding with important clinical implications as it implies that this patient cohort may be cognitively compromised in the future. Nevertheless, control of hypertension may prevent progression of WML (56, 57) and reduce the risk of developing dementia and cognitive decline (62, 63) . Thus, adequate control of hypertension would appear to be mandatory both in patients in remission, usually exposed to hypertension for a long time and with a higher degree of WML, and in active patients to prevent WML progression at an early stage. Patients should be informed on the risks of inadequate control of hypertension and on healthy habits to control hypertension. Education on drugs that may worsen hypertension such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (64, 65) is worth recommending.\n\n Patients in remission taking hydrocortisone had a higher degree of WML than patients who were not on hydrocortisone replacement. This would suggest limiting the use of hydrocortisone as much as possible; in practice, it may be difficult for patients to differentiate symptoms related to adrenal insufficiency from other causes. This may lead to taking extra doses of hydrocortisone, which may worsen hypertension (66) . They should be encouraged to check their blood pressure regularly and to not 'routinely' take extra hydrocortisone doses when suffering from common complaints like tiredness or headache.\n\n This study has several limitations. The small sample size is difficult to avoid in rare diseases, such as CS. It may have led to a low statistical power and possibly prevented the identification of significant findings, mainly in the active patients. Therefore, confirmatory analysis in larger samples of active patients would be needed, for instance, to check if there is a relationship between cardiovascular risk and both cognitive function and brain volume. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of the sample, because different causes of CS have been included, at different stages of the disease. Additionally, for nonparametric data in which differences were identified, no post hoc correction was performed. Longitudinal studies would be necessary to analyse WML progression in active patients and also to investigate the role of hypertension control in both active and in remission CS to prevent WML worsening.\n\n In conclusion, our study describes negative correlations between cardiovascular risk and both brain volume and cognitive function in CS patients in remission. Moreover, it describes a high prevalence of WML in these patients, probably mediated by hypertension. These findings emphasize the importance of controlling cardiovascular risk factors to prevent brain damage in patients who have been diagnosed and treated for CS.\n\n This is linked to the online version of the paper at http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/ EJE-15-0600.\n\n The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.\n\n This work was supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN, FIS080302), the European Commission (ERCUSYN PHP800200) and AGAUR (2014 SGR 355).", "qa": [["80_5344654_5_1", "What are the potential long-term effects of inadequate control of hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome?\n", "Inadequate control of hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome may lead to the progression of white matter lesions (WML) in the brain.

Brain death or cerebral death is defined as irreversible cessation of all brain functions. However, it is difficult -indeed, impossible -to provide diagnostic standards for a condition that has never been adequately defined [ 8 ] . The documentation of brain death is primarily based on clinical criteria from neurologic examinations. In addition, tests including EEG recordings, evoked potentials, cerebral angiography, cerebral scintigraphy and more recently, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), near infrared spectrsocopy (NIRS) and heart rate variability, are used to document the dynamics of cerebral ciruculatory arrest [ 9 , 10 The aim of this present study was to examine transorbital and transtemporal Doppler sonographic recordings during the development of brain death in a 24-year-old patient.\n\n \n\n A 24-year-old male subject from the intensive care unit with clinically defined brain death after severe head injury was investigated using combined multiparametric biosignal recordings. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Graz (10-055 ex 99/00).\n\n Transorbital and transtemporal Doppler sonographic examinations were performed with a portable Multi-Dop T unit (DWL Electronic Systems GmbH, Sipplingen, Germany). A 4 MHz and a 2 MHz probe were used in a multidirectional ultrasound probe holder construction ( \n\n \n\n Electroencephalography remains one of the most wellvalidated confirmatory tests. Recordings were obtained for 30 minutes with a 12-channel instrument (Picker Internat. GmbH, Schwarzer ED14, Munich, Germany).\n\n \n\n A 24-year-old man fell from a height of 4 m and hit a cement block with his head. He was found at the accident site gasping for air. The patient was intubated and respirated upon admittance to the intensive care unit, pupils were bilaterally anisocor and not reactive to light. Brain stem areflexia was present. The first results from CT of the head revealed fractures on the occipital left, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain edema and tentorial herniation. The patient showed clinical signs of brain death.\n\n Instrumental tests showed the following results: Electrical activity was at lower levels than 2 \u00b5V with the instrument set shown in Figure 2 . Transcranial Doppler sonography showed a bilateral oscillating flow in the middle cerebral artery (Fig. 3a) . A residual flow profile was still detectable on both sides transorbitally (Fig. 3b) . Since residual flow could be detected orbitally, cerebral angiography was performed. This showed that the internal carotid artery was poorly perfused on both sides. The right internal carotid artery was occluded distal from the perfused ophthalmic artery, the left middle cerebral artery was poorly perfused. At the same time, missing perfusion of the cerbral anterior artery, the basilar artery and the right middle cerebral artery was visible (Fig. 4) . \n\n The EEG is considered a highly sensitive method for documenting brain death and evaluating cerebral cortical function. For determining brain death this method is the most commonly used confirmatory electronic test in Europe.\n\n However, comparability and validity is influenced by different technical problems and varying evaluative criteria. We must consider, that cerebral acitivity may be detectable even when brain stem functions are missing, which can also be reflected in EEG activity.\n\n Brain death is given, when irreversible loss of entire cerebral function occurs. The definate, clinical diagnosis of brain death does not require an isoelectric EEG. On the other hand, angiographically detectable, remaining circulation can be present despite isoelectric EEG and missing brain stem potentials, which indicates that presumable cerebral functions are given by cerebral blood flow [1] .\n\n New developments in the field of biomedical engineering enable us to accurately register bioelectric activity in the intensive care unit, despite massive interference, in dimensions which were not determinable thus far. Within case reports, our research group recently referred to the problems in defining an \"isoelectric\" EEG [7] .\n\n To our knowledge, there are only two reports dealing with transorbital Doppler sonography and brain death.\n\n Karaali et al. [13] investigated the blood flow velocity changes in orbital arteries by using TCD in 8 patients with brain death. Because of the technical difficulty, this method does not seem to be practical for routine application [13] . Nonetheless, it may be used as an alternative non-invasive method when Doppler studies of the carotid arteries are not adequate due to limiting conditions, such as open wounds, presence of vascular catheters, or large cervical hematomas.\n\n Lampl et al. [18] performed a prospective controlled diagnostic study using transorbital, transtemporal, and transforaminal approaches. Fifty-seven patients with clinically determined brain death were examined. In 2 patients, a positive finding was demonstrated only using the transorbital approach. In brain death transcranial Doppler offers high sensitivity and specificity for a pattern of systolic spikes and oscillating flow. However, due to the difficulty in penetrating the temporal bone barrier with TCD, 10 -15 % of the results have demonstrated a false finding of no flow [18] . Incorporating the transorbital approach could increase the sensitivity and specificity of TCD confirming brain death [18] or could exclude the diagnosis of brain death as shown by the present case report.", "qa": [["28_18220668_0_1", "What are some diagnostic criteria and tests used to determine brain death?\n", "Diagnostic criteria for brain death are primarily based on clinical criteria from neurologic examinations.

In a genetically predisposed individual, environmental factors lead to a dysregulated adaptive immune response resulting in chronic intestinal inflammation and the potential long-term complications of intestinal stricture and perianal disease.\n\n (1) In pediatric CD, there is the additional complication of corticosteroid dependence, resulting in growth failure and significant psychosocial impact. (2) The need for surgical intervention in children is considerable also, with 5% requiring surgery at 1 year from diagnosis and 18% at 5 years. (3) The clinical severity and location of disease often dictate what agents are chosen to treat CD, with the goal being to induce and then maintain long-term remission. Conventionally, 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) therapy, such as mesalamine, is used often for mild disease, although the evidence for this approach is not considered robust. (4) For moderate to severe disease, data reveal that earlier use of immunomodulators, such as the thiopurines or methotrexate, may act to decrease corticosteroid exposure and hospitalizations. (5)(6) Recently, infliximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a, has been shown to be efficacious in the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe pediatric CD. (7) Despite strong evidence for benefit, potential adverse effects, including infection and malignancy, affect the acceptance of immune modulating therapies. (8) The incidence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in pediatric patients with IBD ranges from 40% to 70%, (9)(10)(11)(12) with concern over adverse effects and lack of efficacy of conventional therapies being common reasons for such use. Use of CAM is increased particularly in patients who have a worse quality of life (QoL). (10)(13) In this article, we review the evidence for CAM therapy in CD as drawn from adult and pediatric data available in the English language.\n\n The amino acid glutamine is the preferred substrate for enterocytes, essential in a catabolic state such as IBD. Animal studies reveal glutamine decreases damage in IBD models, potentially by improving intestinal epithelial cell integrity. At this time, however, the beneficial effects of glutamine on human intestinal inflammation have not been demonstrated clearly. (14) The authors of one pediatric and two adult studies have looked both at glutamine as a supplement (15) and as part of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (16) and have not supported the use of glutamine for CD. Another study revealed no difference in plasma glutamine and intestinal permeability in a mixed IBD sample of patients who were randomly assigned to glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition versus glutamine-free total parenteral nutrition. (17) At this time, the available data do not support a recommendation of glutamine for maintenance of remission or treatment of disease flares.\n\n Fish oil and other sources of omega-3 fatty acids have been theorized to be effective in IBD therapy due to their inhibitory effect on the cyclooxygenase pathway, decreasing the formation of arachadonic acid as a substrate for the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The authors of the single pediatric study compared 18 patients who received 5-ASA in combination with 3 g/day of omega-3 fatty acid with 20 patients who received 5-ASA and an olive oil placebo. (20) The omega-3 fatty acid group had a significantly lower relapse rate at 1 year compared with the placebo group (61% vs 95%, P \u00bc .0016). This small but well-designed trial is the only one to use fish oil supplementation in combination with other CD therapy. It is possible that the combination of 5-ASA and fish oil may have a synergistic antiinflammatory effect. Additional large pediatric studies using a combination of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and conventional immunosuppressive therapy are needed to demonstrate a role for routine fish oil use in CD.\n\n Probiotic use is popular, with an average of 40% of pediatric patients with IBD having tried a probiotic preparation, (9)(10)(11)(12)(22) but evidence for clinical efficacy in CD is limited. In vitro and animal studies have revealed that probiotics can stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine production and strengthen the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. (23) The authors of adult trials have examined the use of probiotics, including Lactobacillus GG, (24) Lactobacillus johnsonii, (25)(26) and a blend of preand probiotics (27) for prevention of postoperative recurrence; however, no effect was found.", "qa": [["40_17706783_0_1", "What are the potential long-term complications of Crohn disease?\n", "The potential long-term complications of Crohn disease include intestinal stricture and perianal disease."], ["40_17706783_0_2", "What are some treatment options for moderate to severe pediatric Crohn disease?\n", "Some treatment options for moderate to severe pediatric Crohn disease include immunomodulators such as thiopurines or methotrexate, as well as infliximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a."], ["40_17706783_0_3", "What is the evidence for the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in pediatric patients with Crohn disease?\n", "The incidence of CAM use in pediatric patients with Crohn disease ranges from 40% to 70%.

Lebanese adults (41) belonging to the fifth quintile of the 'fast food/dessert' factor score (rich in fast foods, sandwiches including hamburgers, chawarma and falafel in addition to pizzas, pies, desserts, carbonated beverages, juices and mayonnaise) had significantly higher odds of hyperglycaemia. In Sweden (42) , the most striking findings were a higher risk of hyperglycaemia with the 'many foods and drinks' pattern (with high intakes of cheese, cake, fat meat and alcohol) for men. The positive effects of the 'fruits, eggs and juice' and 'alcohol, milk and tea' patterns can be attributed to their higher saturated fat and carbohydrate content and excess energy intake, which may lead to hyperglycaemia (38) . A very high intake of fruits and especially juice might be unbeneficial for the Nanjing Chinese population, as other researchers (20, 43) also have found. Dairy products have been associated with diabetes risk due to their high fat content, but low-fat dairy products may have beneficial effects (21, 44) . Unfortunately, we were not able to differentiate between high-and low-fat products. Consistent with our results, many epidemiological studies (45, 46) have reported a positive association between alcohol consumption and diabetes risk.\n\n The inconsistent results for the relationship between dietary patterns and risk hyperglycaemia by sex may be due to diverse dietary habits observed in men and women. Men had higher scores on the 'healthy traditional' and the 'alcohol, milk and tea' patterns and relatively higher intakes of vegetables, alcohol consumption and dairy products.\n\n Previous studies (41, 47) have reported that dietary patterns were related to sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviours. Higher SES (more likely to have higher income and education levels) was usually found to be associated with higher scores on the healthy dietary pattern (48) . Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as cigarette smoking, alcohol intake and physical inactivity were reportedly related to unhealthy dietary patterns (13, 47) . Our results were in accordance with these studies. In the present study, male, high education level, higher income, more physically active, non-smoker and non-drinker were more likely among those adhering to the 'healthy traditional' pattern. In contrast, people with a higher score for the 'animal and plant protein' and the 'fruits, eggs and juice' patterns had lower income, but were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people with a lower score. The relationship between higher SES and the 'healthy traditional' pattern could be because of increased knowledge and health awareness, or increased pressures of social acceptability that occur with increasing SES, which may influence people's food consumption habits. Among the lower SES groups, the increased cost of healthier foods or decreased access to healthier foods may be important factors influencing their food choices. People who have less money could choose to buy cheaper foods and these cheaper foods are generally unhealthy (48) . The present study had several potential limitations. First, compared with relevant foreign studies (11) (12) (13) (14) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , the sample size was small and the duration of follow-up period was short, so some predisposing factors may not have achieved statistical significance. Moreover, the complete follow-up rate was relatively low. Although no significant differences existed between participants who were followed up and those lost to follow-up, the bias caused by these missing data should be taken into consideration. Second, dietary intake was assessed by FFQ. The major sources of errors in FFQ include memory, interpretation of questions, perception of portion sizes and the restricted food list. However, FFQ have become commonly used instruments for measuring relationships between nutrient intakes and diseases in epidemiological studies in Western countries in recent decades. Third, dietary patterns are likely to vary according to sex, age, area of residence, ethnic group and culture. It is possible that different eating patterns are derived from different populations (8, 16, 34) . This does not necessarily refute the validity of pattern analysis (8, 31, 34, 49) . Furthermore, decisions based on factor analysis (including the consolidation of food items into food groups, the number of factors to extract, the method of rotation and the labelling of the components) may be subjective or arbitrary and can affect the study results and interpretation (50) . Factor analysis is considered an a posteriori approach because it generates patterns based on available empirical data without a priori hypotheses. Nevertheless, this method offers an opportunity to summarize and refine large amounts of data into a simple descriptive pattern (8) (9) (10) . Finally, we used BMI instead of WC for an obesity index. However, BMI is widely accepted and has consistently been shown to be related to diabetes risk factors in the Chinese population (51) . The present study has several strengths. First, the population-based prospective study design can minimize selection bias and examine the causal relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of hyperglycaemia. Second, the comprehensive information on lifestyle and dietary factors allowed for adjustment of a broad range of potential confounding variables. Finally, we collected individual food consumption information by an interviewer-administered FFQ. Based on the current educational levels of most of the Chinese population, a self-administered FFQ survey is not advisable and a face-to-face interview is the proper approach (33) . In addition, the experienced interviewer is able to obtain more precise and accurate estimates of the different portion sizes of each food consumed, thus minimizing the error involved in having participants try to estimate the amount of food consumed and the between-person error in portion size estimation among participants (30, 52) .\n\n Our results indicated that a dietary pattern characterized by higher intakes of green vegetables, rice and products, dry vegetables, other vegetables, and fish and shrimp was inversely associated with risk of incident hyperglycaemia, whereas a pattern with higher intakes of fruits, soyabean milk, juice, nuts, cola and sweets and a pattern with higher intakes of beer, liquor, dairy products, wine and tea were associated with a significantly increased risk of hyperglycaemia in a cohort of Chinese men and women in Nanjing.

The subjects were instructed not to smoke after midnight, to empty the bladder as usual on awakening, and to eat no breakfast but to drink 3-4 dl tea. In a first series of experiments (n = ll), subjects were lying comfortably supine on a bed in a laboratory with an ambient temperature of 22-24\u00b0 C. When an intraneural electrode position with acceptable signalto-noise ratio was found (accounting for 10-60 minutes), the basal level of nerve activity was followed during 15 minutes of rest. Thereafter, the subjects were given water to drink (through a straw in the supine position), 2 dl at a time with intervals of 5-10 minutes until a moderate degree of bladder filling was felt; the amount of water given ranged from 2 to 20 dl, mean 9.5 dl. The recording then went on during supine rest until the urge to empty the bladder was irresistible, and the experiment was discontinued. A second series of experiments comprised five male subjects who sat in a semirecumbent position during the recording and who had a condom catheter applied before the recording; the same procedure took place as in the first experiment. Thus, the subjects were able to void without interruption of the nerve recording, and thereafter the recording was continued at rest for about 10 minutes.\n\n Blood pressure was measured noninvasively with an automatic blood pressure recorder (EME Ltd, Brighton, U.K.) every third minute throughout the experiment and every minute during the final phase. In the five male subjects who emptied the bladder during ongoing recording, noninvasive continuous finger arterial blood pressure monitoring (Finapres, Ohmeda, Englewood, Colorado) 14 was also used. In seven subjects of the first series, blood samples for plasma norepinephrine analysis were drawn during initial rest and when the subject assessed that he could wait only another 5 minutes before emptying the bladder; an intravenous cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein for this purpose before the nerve recording was initiated.\n\n The subjects were instructed to relax and to indicate the increasing degree of the sensation of bladder filling on an analogue scale, with 0 representing a complete lack of this sensation and 10 representing an irresistible desire to void.\n\n Blood samples were collected into prechilled EDTA tubes, placed on ice immediately, and centrifuged promptly at +4\u00b0 C. Plasma samples were stored at -70\u00b0 C until analyzed. Plasma norepinephrine was determined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with colorimetric detection. 15 The method has an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 2% in the physiological concentration range.\n\n The mean voltage neurogram, ECG, respiratory movements, and finger arterial pressure were written out on paper, 2.5 mm/sec, with an ink-jet recorder (Siemens-Elema, Stockholm, Sweden). The bursts of muscle nerve sympathetic activity, time-locked in the cardiac rhythm (see Figure 1 ), were counted during 10 minutes of initial rest, during the last 6 minutes before micturition, and during 6 minutes at rest after micturition in the five experiments where the recording continued. Thus, a mean value of sympathetic outflow, expressed in bursts per minute, was calculated during the periods under study for each subject. Heart rate and respiratory rate were obtained from the same paper display. Because the two experimental series provided the same result, they were analyzed together (n=16); a separate analysis of the second series (n=5) was made only for assessment of final rest after micturition.\n\n The burst amplitude in the mean voltage neurogram, reflecting the strength of individual bursts of sympathetic activity, is critically dependent on the electrode position intraneurally, and cannot be compared between different recordings. Within a given recording, however, burst amplitude can be compared between different parts of the recording, provided the intraneural electrode site remains unchanged. 16 Therefore, mean burst amplitude for the periods of initial rest and during strong urge to urinate was calculated as the mean of 50 consecutive bursts during that period for each subject.

In particular, in the US, unsatisfactory rates with liquid cytology are generally less than 1% to slightly over 2% (19) . This enhancement is primar-ily achieved by a better cellular preservation and by a fairly uniform thickness of cellular deposit that allows for optimal viewing of cellular morphology and gives the opportunity of computer-assisted screening (22). Currently, LBC constitutes over 80% of cervical screening tests in the USA. In 2003, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended the introduction of LBC as the primary way of processing samples in Cervical Cancer Screening Program (23) . Another undoubted advantage of the LBC approach is that, since only an aliquot of cell suspension is removed from the vial to prepare cytological glass slide, the residual cell suspension provides a specimen for additional investigations such as immunocytochemical or molecular procedures. These ancillary tools, more closely related to cervical carcinogenesis, would further improve the sensitivity and the specificity of the screening test and would offer a better diagnostic value in identifying the correct management of women whose cytological lesions remain controversial.\n\n Recently, a significant increase in the understanding of the natural history and the molecular pathogenesis of cervical cancer has been achieved. At present, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections are among the most common sexually transmitted disease (24). In the United States alone, it was estimated that 6.2 million of new infections occur annually in individuals, with an approximately prevalence of 20 million (25). The typical age of cervical HPV infection is similar to other sexually transmitted diseases, the highest peak of prevalence being present at the third decade (24-30%). Cumulative prevalence of HPV infection in sexually active asymptomatic women of reproductive age is on the order of 5-40%. High risk HPV (HR-HPV) prevalence is between 4 and 20% (26); it is age-dependent and gradually decreases with age (27). In most cases, genital HR-HPV infection is transient or intermittent: in particular, only 10% of infected women remain HPV-positive within 5 years. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) calculated that at least half of all sexually active individuals will acquire HPV at some points of their lives, whereas at least 80% of women will acquire an HPV infection by age 50. Rates of infection appear to continue to be rapidly increasing.\n\n Cervical cancer is characterized by a well-defined pre-malignant phases that can be highlighted by cytological examination of exfoliated cervical cells. These pre-malignant changes represent a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from LSIL to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The identification of viral and host factors that modulate the risk of developing cervicocarcinoma in HPV infected women necessarily requires a complete understanding of viral biology.\n\n HPV is a small, ubiquitous DNA-virus with an approximately 7900 base-pairs genome enclosed in icosahedral capsid consisting of two late proteins: L1 and L2. HPV genome consists of a single molecule of double-stranded circular DNA. The Open Reading Frame (ORF) protein-coding sequences are restricted to one strand. The genome is functionally divided into three regions. The first is a non-coding one referred as Long Control Region (LCR) or Upper Regulatory Region (URR). This section of HPV's genome includes enhancer and silencer sequences that regulate DNA replication by controlling the transcription of the ORFs. The second is the Early Region (E), consisting of the ORFs E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7, which are implicated in viral replication and oncogenesis. The third is the Late Region (L) that encodes the aforesaid capsidic structural proteins L1 and L2.\n\n More than 100 genotypes of HPV have been isolated and branded molecularly. They can infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or inner lining of tissues and are categorized as cutaneous or mucosal types. Cutaneous varieties are epidermotrophic and recognize as elective center the skin, in particular that of hands and feet; mucosal types show tropism towards respiratory, intestinal, and lower genital tract epithelium.

The hallmark of the disease is weakness and rapid fatigability of voluntary skeletal muscles with repetitive use, followed by partial recovery with rest [1] . The incidence is about 1 in every 20,000 adults. It is twice as common in women as in men, and frequently affects young women in the second and third decades of life, which overlaps with the childbearing age [2] [3] . Here, we present a case of pregnant woman with MG, in whom anesthesia for caesarean section (CS) required special attention.\n\n A 38-year-old gravida-3 para-2 (vaginal and CS) patient was diagnosed as having MG 2 years ago. The patient presented for emergency CS due to premature rupture of the membranes. When the neurologist caring for the patient was contacted, he confirmed the diagnosis and informed us of the patient's medications.\n\n These included pyridostigmine 500 mg bd, tab prednisolone 10 mg daily and tab mycophenslate 500 mg bd. The patient's condition had been stable throughout her pregnancy, and the obstetrician was hoping for a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery when she developed premature rupture of membranes.\n\n On admission, she had no muscle weakness and no bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia, dysarthria or nasal speech. She had no shortness of breath or dyspnoea. Airway examination revealed limited neck flexion and Mallampatti II classification. Her last meal intake was the previous night meaning the patient had fasted for more than 8 hours.\n\n Before we discussed anaesthesia options with the patient, the patient objected to general anaesthesia on the advice of her neurologist, who had told her she would not wake up if she would undergo general anaesthesia. Our first choice of anaesthesia was neuraxial anaesthesia. Baseline preoperative monitoring revealed blood pressure 130/90 mmHg, sinus rhythm of 94 bpm, and SPO 2 of 96% on room air. From L3/4, the spinal block was attempted by an experienced anaesthesiologist; however, it was unsuccessful. After many attempts over almost an hour, spinal anaesthesia was abandoned. Our next option was to resort to general anaesthesia. Since the patient had objected to general anaesthesia on the advice of her neurologist, we explained to her that general anaesthesia was not contraindicated in MG patients. This case was especially challenging because it was an emergency: we could not postpone CS. \n\n After a careful assessment, we concluded that endotracheal intubation would be extremely difficult since a video laryngoscope or other adjuncts were unavailable. With a very limited chance of successful intubation, a decision was made to not give any muscle relaxant. Instead, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted successfully to provide good ventilation. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 2% -3% MAC. The CS was successfully completed, lasting 40 minutes with no problems intraoperatively. The baby was delivered healthy with an APGAR score of 9/9 (1/5 minutes). There was no sign of muscle weakness and no bulbar symptoms.\n\n We present a pregnant woman with MG requiring emergent CS, who had an unsuspected difficult airway. She had a failed lumbar puncture and was also difficult to intubate. Eventually, general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway was performed, with successfull anaesthesia and CS.\n\n The basic defect resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and easy fatigability in MG is a decrease in the number of available receptors for acetylcholine at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. This decrease is due to their inactivation or destruction by circulating antibodies. Attachment of these antibodies to receptors for acetylcholine either blocks neurotransmitter access to receptors or accelerates degradation of receptors [4] [5] . Principles for anaesthesia management of patients with MG includes avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents whenever possible. If necessary, reversal of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent should be done with sugammadex instead of neostigmine whenever possible. Premedication should also be avoided, and the patient should rather be counselled and reassured. If premedication with midazolam must be used, it should be given in small incremental doses with close attention to signs of bulbar weakness and respiratory compromise [6] .

The flow control valve allows for more precise control of the peak inspiratory pressure applied to the infant's lung, decreases the risk of lung barotrauma, and enables application of prolonged initial inflation breaths and positive end-expiratory pressure to be maintained between inflations, and can give continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) when it is not being used as a ventilator. The T-piece resuscitator was found more consistently to deliver target pressures and prolonged inflation independent of the operator's expertise compared with manual bagging devices. 37 In a qualitative review of 30 trials comparing the T-piece resuscitator with self-inflating bags, two on infants and 28 on manikins, no superiority was found for the T-piece resuscitator over the self-inflating bag in the infant trials, but in the manikin studies the T-piece resuscitator was able to deliver inflating pressures closer to predetermined target pressures with minimal variation and to provide prolonged inflation breaths and more consistent tidal volumes. 38 Currently, target ventilation variables with the T-piece resuscitator include a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cm H 2 O, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cm H 2 O. 39 \n\n The first breaths in a full term newborn have a prolonged expiratory phase associated with a high positive intrathoracic pressure, and a brief inspiratory component to facilitate the distribution of air within the lungs and to assist in formation of the functional residual capacity. 40 In an experimental study, it was found that sustained inflation of preterm rabbit lungs for durations of 10 or 20 seconds increased the inspiratory volume and produced a greater functional residual capacity compared with durations of one or 5 seconds. 41 Sustained lung inflation for 20 seconds in combination with positive end-expiratory pressure was found to improve the functional residual capacity of preterm rabbit pups. 42 In asphyxiated full term infants, sustained lung inflation during resuscitation was found to increase their tidal volume and the functional residual capacity. 43 The European Resuscitation Council has recommended that initial inflation of the lung should be 2-3 seconds in duration to achieve a sustained lung inflation technique. 44, 45 In preterm infants, sustained lung inflation for 5 seconds compared with traditional lung inflation for 2 seconds did not reduce lung injury, as measured by inflammatory cytokines. 46 Lindner et al compared sustained lung inflation with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome in the delivery room, and found no significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation or rate of adverse effects. 47 te Pas and Walther found a decrease in need for intubation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants of more than 28 weeks' gestation treated by sustained lung inflation at a pressure of 20 cm H 2 O for 10 seconds using a T-piece resuscitator compared with a self-inflating bag and mask in the delivery room. 48 In preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, sustained lung inflation at a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O for 15 seconds using a T-piece resuscitator was found to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation compared with using a T-piece resuscitator without sustained lung inflation, without inducing evident adverse effects. 49 However, issues like appropriate duration and pressure, hemodynamic changes, and risk of barotrauma, should be further evaluated before recommending routine use of sustained lung inflation in the resuscitation of preterm infants.\n\n CPAP is a technique of respiratory support that generates a continuous distending pressure to the lung and is delivered to spontaneously breathing infants. Usually, a pressure of 4-8 cm H 2 O is used to distend the airways and alveoli. CPAP improves oxygenation without increasing peripheral arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ) through stabilization and recruitment of collapsed alveoli.

For example, the heterodimer composed of epidermal growth factor receptor plus HER2 activates the RAS/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C, gamma (PLC\u03b3) signaling pathways. 5, 6 In contrast, the HER2 homodimer lacks phosphorylated tyrosines in its cytoplasmic tail, preventing it from docking to the PI3K pathway adaptor protein p85 and activating PI3K signaling. Instead, engagement of the HER2 homodimer primarily activates the GRB2 and SHC adaptor proteins that initiate RAS/MAPK signaling. 7 A heterodimer containing HER2 plus HER3 relies on HER3 for its signaling. Unlike HER2, HER3 can bind to p85 and triggers strong activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. 8 To identify novel regulators of HER2 signaling, we performed two unbiased RNA interference loss-of-function screens. Highthroughput RNA interference screens using small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment of cancer cell lines have previously been utilized to identify novel drug targets. 9, 10 We used a library of siRNAs directed specifically at kinases to examine 12 breast cancer cell lines, five of which were HER2+. Our first approach ('comprehensive screen') was designed to identify kinases whose inhibition specifically reduced growth of HER2+ cell lines but had no effect on growth of non-HER2+ cells or normal breast cells. This was performed by Comparative Marker Selection (CMS) (Gene Pattern, MIT), where permutation testing revealed the least number of genes (in our case, siRNAs) able to distinguish two predetermined groups (HER2 amplified and HER2 non-amplified). In our second approach ('sensitizer screen'), we identified siRNAs that sensitized HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment; that is, we pinpointed kinases whose inhibition in combination with trastuzumab further reduced the proliferation of HER2+ cells. The results of these screens show that HER2 and HER3 are the strongest drivers of oncogenic HER2 signaling. We also demonstrate that targeting downstream members of the PI3K pathway in combination with trastuzumab leads to a greater degree of inhibition of HER2+ cell proliferation. Our data suggest several potential combination therapies that may provide more effective treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.\n\n Identification of kinases whose inhibition reduces breast cancer cell line proliferation Fourteen cell lines comprising various breast cancer subtypes and normal breast cell line controls were selected for high-throughput siRNA screening with an siRNA library targeting 778 kinases and kinase-related genes (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). These cell lines included four lacking the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression (Triple-negative breast cancers; ER\u2212 /PR \u2212 /HER2 \u2212 ); three that were (ER+; ER+/PR\u00b1/ HER2 \u2212 ); five that were HER2+ (HER2+; ER \u00b1 /PR \u00b1 ) and two that were derived from normal breast tissue. Schematic diagrams illustrating our comprehensive and sensitizer screens are shown in Figure 1 . The comprehensive approach sought to screen all 14 cell lines to identify kinases whose inhibition had an effect on the growth of only HER2+ breast cancer cells ( Figure 1a ). Kinases affecting other breast cancer subtypes are to be described in separate article. The sensitizer approach sought to identify kinases whose inhibition further decreased the proliferation of trastuzumab-treated HER2+ cells ( Figure 1b ).

In addition, head and neck cancer is the sixth most common type of solid cancer diagnosed worldwide (2) . Since the majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, intensive surgical therapy followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy is often required. Usually, cisplatin is used as a powerful radiosensitizer, and therefore remains an integral part of head and neck cancer therapy (3) . However, the cure rate of head and neck cancer remains at ~50% (4); therefore, there is an urgent requirement to improve treatment and survival rates. One possible approach involves the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related signaling. More than 90% of head and neck cancers exhibit EGFR overexpression (5, 6) . Notably, increased levels of EGFR are associated with a poorer prognosis (7) , and less differentiated head and neck cancers exhibit higher levels of EGFR (8) . Furthermore, EGFR expression is associated with resistance to radiotherapy, locoregional treatment failure, and an increased rate of distant metastases (9) . These findings led to the development of agents directed against EGFR. In 2006, cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer (10) . In addition to targeting EGFR by inhibiting the extracellular ligand binding domain, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) suppress intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. Particularly in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), agents such as gefitinib and erlotinib are widely used (11) . However, in contrast to NSCLC, where tumors frequently harbor EGFR kinase domain mutations, head and neck cancer lesions predominantly possess wild-type EGFR (12, 13) . This finding may partly explain why erlotinib failed to improve the complete response rate or progression-free survival of locally advanced head and neck cancers treated with a cisplatin/radiotherapy-based regimen (14) . At present, there are no markers predictive of response to anti-EGFR therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and TKIs. However, ongoing research may identify such markers, and more accurate patient selection will improve the benefits of TKI-based therapy in a subset of patients with head and neck cancer. Another aspect regarding the treatment failure of anti-EGFR approaches could be lateral signaling, as well as the activation of alternative receptors and downstream molecules, including other members of the ErbB family. Wheeler et al (15) demonstrated that human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 and HER3 are strongly activated in cetuximab-resistant cells. Furthermore, EGFR upregulation led to increased dimerization with HER2 and HER3. Consequently, the inhibition of EGFR and HER2 resulted in decreased HER3 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity (15) . At present, few in vitro studies concerning dual blockade of EGFR and HER2 have been conducted in head and neck cancer. Sch\u00fctze et al (16) demonstrated a clear antiproliferative effect of afatinib, an EGFR/HER2/HER4 TKI. Notably, the radiosensitizing effect was only marginal; however, the study was conducted with only one cell line (FaDu) (16) . To date, only one clinical trial regarding afatinib for the treatment of head and neck cancer has been published. Seiwert et al (17) compared afatinib treatment with cetuximab treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer who progressed after platinum-based therapy. The antitumor activity of afatinib was comparable to that of cetuximab; however, more patients in the afatinib group discontinued treatment due to adverse events.\n\n In the present study, the rationale for combining afatinib with cisplatin was based on three considerations. Firstly, cisplatin serves as a radiosensitizer, and chemoradiotherapy remains the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer. Secondly, EGFR overexpression is known to contribute to radiotherapy resistance. Finally, EGFR overexpression leads to the activation of other ErbB family members, including HER2 and HER4.\n\n To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the efficacy of afatinib in combination with cisplatin in wild-type EGFR head and neck cancer cell lines.\n\n Cell lines.

Virtually all of these changes are characterized by increased numbers of cells expressing \u2423-SM actin (115) . It has been thought that the SM-like cells that express \u2423-SM actin and accumulate in vascular lesions were derived from the expansion of resident vascular SMCs or adventitial fibroblasts. However, new data suggest other possible sources of \u2423-SM actin-expressing cells (SM-like cells and/or myofibroblasts) in various vascular diseases. Circulating progenitor cells can assume an SM-like phenotype (116) . Resident vascular progenitor cells have also been demonstrated to express SM-like characteristics in several vascular injury states (117) . Finally, the possibility that both epithelial and endothelial cells have the capability of transitioning into a mesenchymal or SM-like phenotype has been raised. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition. The term endothelialmesenchymal transition (EnMT), rather than transformation or transdifferentiation, relates to epithelial biology, where the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been more thoroughly investigated. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a process in which epithelial cells lose cell-to-cell contacts and polarity and undergo dramatic remodeling of the cytoskeleton (118) , with repression of epithelial markers. Concurrently, cells begin to express mesenchymal antigens, including FSP-1, \u2423-SM actin, fibronectin, and types I and III collagens, and manifest a proliferative and migratory phenotype. The transition of epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal phenotype occurs during embryonic development, and recent data suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal transition is important in cancer biology. A role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition during tissue injury leading to organ fibrosis is also becoming clear.\n\n Less is known regarding EnMT than epithelialmesenchymal transition. However, several groups have provided evidence that EnMT is critical in aortic and PA development (119) . Endothelial cells labeled at an early stage of development appear later (at the onset of SMC differentiation) in the subendothelial space of the developing aorta and express \u2423-SM actin (120) . Morphologic studies in human embryos suggest that endothelial-like cells may give rise to SMC during the maturation of both PAs and veins (121) . Findings in experimental wound repair have suggested that EnMT may also take place in the adult. Similarly, microvascular ECs transition into mesenchymal cells in response to chronic inflammatory stimuli (122) . A role for EnMT in the neointimal thickening observed in transplant atherosclerosis and restenosis has also been suggested (120) .\n\n Endothelial cells from a variety of vascular beds retain the capability of transitioning into mesenchymal or even SMlike cells under several culture conditions (119) . Endothelial cells derived from the adult bovine aorta convert to spindleshaped \u2423-SM actin-expressing cells when treated with TGF\u2424-1 (123) . Human dermal microvascular ECs can be induced to transform into myofibroblasts in vitro, after long-term exposure to inflammatory cytokines (124) . Recent studies have demonstrated that hypoxia is also capable of inducing transdifferentiation of PAECs into myofibroblast or SM-like cells in a process regulated by myocardin (125) .\n\n Bone marrow-derived circulating cells, known as fibrocytes, may be a source for myofibroblast accumulation during reparative processes in the lung (126) . Fibrocytes are mesenchymal progenitors that coexpress hematopoietic stem cell antigens, markers of the monocyte lineage, and fibroblast products. They constitutively produce ECM components as well as ECM-modifying enzymes and can further differentiate into myofibroblasts. These cells can contribute to the new population of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that emerge at tissue sites during normal or aberrant wound healing, in ischemic or inflammatory fibrotic processes, and as part of the stromal reaction to tumor development (127) .\n\n The fibrocyte may differentiate into mature mesenchymal cells in vivo. Differentiation of fibrocytes into myofibroblastlike cells occurs where there is increased production of TGF\u2424-1 and/or endothelin. In these settings, fibrocytes or fibrocyte precursor cells demonstrate downregulation of leukocytic markers (e.g., CD34 and CD45) with a concomitant upregulation of mesenchymal markers. A causal link between accumulation of fibrocytes at injured sites and ongoing tissue fibrogenesis or vascular remodeling has been provided in animal models of pulmonary disease (116) . Inhibition of fibrocyte accumulation results in reduced collagen deposition and reduced accumulation of myofibroblasts. In the chronically hypoxic rat, monocyte/fibrocyte depletion markedly attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling (116) .\n\n The transition of any cell type including ECs, progenitor cells, fibroblasts, or even SMC into a myofibroblast becomes relevant to a better understanding of PH, as myofibroblasts can generate long-lasting constriction regulated at the level of Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated inhibition of MLC phosphatase (128) . Thus, cells that have transitioned into fibroblastlike and myofibroblastlike cells may play a role in the inability of the vessel wall to dilate in response to traditional vasodilating stimuli.", "qa": [["82_205531115_8_1", "What are the possible sources of \u03b1-SM actin-expressing cells in various vascular diseases?\n", "New data suggests that \u03b1-SM actin-expressing cells in vascular diseases can be derived from circulating progenitor cells assuming a smooth muscle-like phenotype, resident vascular progenitor cells expressing smooth muscle-like characteristics, and the transition of epithelial and endothelial cells into a mesenchymal or smooth muscle-like phenotype."], ["82_205531115_8_2", "How does endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT) contribute to aortic and pulmonary artery development?\n", "Studies have shown that endothelial cells labeled at an early stage of development later appear in the subendothelial space of the developing aorta and express \u03b1-SM actin, suggesting that endothelial-mesenchymal transition is critical in aortic and pulmonary artery development.

From this point, the popliteus tendon courses distally and posteriorly, where it gives off three fascicles to the lateral meniscus (anteroinferior, posterosuperior, and posteroinferior fascicles). 25, 28 These fascicles have been shown to have importance in providing stability to motion of the lateral meniscus. 12 After this point, the popliteus tendon continues more distally to the musculotendinous junction. At the musculotendinous junction, there are two divisions of the popliteofibular ligament that course laterally and distally from the musculotendinous junction to attach on the posteromedial aspect of the fibular styloid. 25, 28 The popliteofibular ligament complex has been found to be an important stabilizer of external rotation of the knee. 20 In addition to the structures previously mentioned, the popliteus muscle also has an aponeurotic layer that courses from the popliteus muscle belly up to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. 28 The midthird lateral capsular ligament is a thickening of the lateral capsule of the knee. 28 It is thought to be semiequivalent to the deep medial collateral ligament complex of the medial aspect of the knee. 12 This thickening of the lateral capsule extends from the capsular attachments from just anterior to the popliteus tendon attachment on the femur to the lateral gastrocnemius attachment. It then extends distally to its tibial attachment from slightly posterior to Gerdy's tubercle to the popliteal hiatus.\n\n The midthird lateral capsular ligament can be divided into two components. The meniscofemoral component extends from the femur down to the meniscus. The meniscotibial component extends from the meniscus to the tibia.
