It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Genetic counseling is an important component of a patient's care and can be a source of much-needed key information about the disease for the families of patients that will help them make informed medical and personal decisions. Genetic counseling should be offered to all families with an affected child and all adults diagnosed with Pompe disease either through newborn screening (NBS), clinical diagnosis, or prenatal diagnosis. 1 In addition to providing information about the genetic risks and inheritance of Pompe disease, genetic counseling can be a valuable source of information about the natural history of the disease as well as available treatments and resources that can help patients and their families. 2 Recognizing the important role that NBS plays in identifying infants with serious and, unless diagnosed early, often potentially fatal illnesses, the National Society of Genetic Counselors in the United States strongly supports screening all newborns for the panel of disorders recommended by the US Secretary of Health and Human Services on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), with the exception of cases where parents make an informed decision to decline or opt out of screening after being thoroughly educated on NBS. 3 Telegenetics is an additional means for providing genetic counseling. Telegenetics collectively includes telemedicine, which typically refers to remote clinical services and tends to be patient-centric (eg, patient and provider interactions through videoconferencing or telephone), and telehealth, which is broader and more encompassing and can refer to nonclinical services (eg, health care-provider training and education, patient/family education, and team meetings) in addition to clinical services. Telegenetics is especially valuable for underserved areas where services are limited or not available and for locations that pose geographic barriers and therefore restrict or limit access to specialized care. 4 Many states are amenable to telegenetic services and suggest them as an option for genetic counseling. Where genetic counseling may not be offered, the availability of telegenetics should be investigated.\n\n Pompe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected individual are assumed to be obligate heterozygotes carrying a single copy of an acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA) pathogenic variant or deletion in the majority of cases. 1 Confounding factors in counseling may include undisclosed donor egg/sperm, uniparental disomy, the rare chance of germ-line mosaicism or de novo variant, and nonpaternity.\n\n Each full sibling of an individual with Pompe disease at conception has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier of Pompe disease. 2 When an at-risk sibling is confirmed to be unaffected, their chance of being a carrier of Pompe disease is 2 out of 3. Half-siblings have a 50% chance of being a carrier of Pompe disease.\n\n The sibling phenotype concordance in classic IOPD is high. 5 Classic IOPD is the most severe form of Pompe disease, with symptoms presenting before 12 months of age with cardiomyopathy. 6 Phenotype discordance (ie, onset, course, and severity) has been observed within and between families with identical GAA genotypes of patients presenting with non-classic IOPD (patients presenting with symptoms before the age of 12 months but without cardiomyopathy) and patients with LOPD (patients with symptom onset after 12 months of age), 6 indicating that other factors (eg, environmental and epigenetic) may modify the clinical course in patients. [7] [8] [9] Children with classic IOPD have not historically survived to adulthood to reproduce, although the availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may improve their fitness and prolong their survival. All of the offspring of an individual with Pompe disease are obligate heterozygotes (carriers) for a pathogenic variant in GAA, although they may inherit different alleles. If an individual with Pompe disease has a child with another individual with Pompe disease, all of their children will have Pompe disease.

' Nevertheless, grumbling over unpaid bills and personality clashes marred the celebrations back home. Skoryna never wrote a final report.\n\n Through lack of advance planning, METEI encountered a number of surprises. For example, the population was far more heterogeneous, genetically speaking, than had been anticipated. [13] In particular, newcomers brought from Tahiti in the 1860s, following decimation of the Islanders by smallpox, had made a significant contribution to the gene pool. The islanders were well aware of the problems of inbreeding and it has been suggested that in the past they eagerly encouraged relations with travellers. The genetic diversity was evident in the later analysis of the blood groups and enzymes; some of this work had been accomplished by a Chilean team on a visit 1 year earlier. [14] Unfortunately, a set of METEI's blood samples were spoiled. Virologist Armand Boudreault identified a lack of immunity to polio. [15] Consequently, in March -April 1967, Isabel Griffiths and Carlotta Hacker returned to Easter Island, now with an airstrip, bringing sufficient vaccine to immunise the entire population. [16, 17] One other discovery arising from the journey took years to unfold. A Montreal bacteriologist, the Hungarian-born Georges N\u00f3gr\u00e1dy, had brought back hundreds of samples containing soil microbes. One of these organisms, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, was specific to Rapa Nui and was found to have antifungal activity. He gave the sample to Suren Sehgal, a pharmacologist working for the Ayerst pharmaceutical company, who persisted in investigating the microbe and its secretions even beyond the sale of the company to Wyeth. The work eventually resulted in the drug, sirolimus (rapamycin), used not only as an antibiotic but also in transplantation medicine and cancer chemotherapy. It is the first in the important class, now known as mTOR inhibitors, the acronym deriving from 'mammalian target of rapamycin. ' [18, 19] No follow-up study was conducted, and Peter Beighton never returned to Easter Island, but he kept up with some fellow travellers over the years and has many vivid memories and photographs from the adventure. METEI had opened his eyes to the possibilities of research, and the system used to keep track of Easter Islanders moving through investigations is one that he used again in research studies elsewhere, including large-scale epidemiological investigations of bone and joint disorders in indigenous African populations at the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Cape Town following his move to South Africa in 1970.", "qa": [["24_29296892_2_1", "What are the potential genetic risk factors for the population of Easter Island?\n", "The population of Easter Island was found to be more genetically heterogeneous than anticipated.

Dental and maxillofacial diagnosis and treatment planning commonly employ different forms of CT, including 64-slice and cone beam CT (CBCT), and studies have been carried out to calculate effective doses for select protocols [2, 3] . Wu et al. [4] recently reported that the radiological exposure from 64-slice CT is associated with a non-negligible lifetime-attributable risk for cancer among the most radiosensitive patients. Despite these risks, CT and CBCT have shown to be useful for the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of the teeth, and vital structures such as the mandibular canal for treatment planning, guided surgery and outcome assessment [5] [6] [7] .\n\n The display of both hard tissue (enamel, dentin, cementum and bone) and soft tissue (gingiva, dental pulp, neurovascular bundle, mucosa, lips and facial tissues) is essential for diagnosis and treatment in various disciplines of dentistry. Some intraoral soft tissues, such as gingiva, are poorly distinguishable in CT and even more poorly so in CBCT, which is a clinically relevant drawback of these techniques.\n\n The need for non-invasive, non-ionizing diagnostic tools has stimulated research on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the maxillofacial region, but has historically been limited by its comparably low spatial resolution and feasibility concerns, such as lesser availability of equipment, long image acquisition times and high cost. Furthermore, despite a superior display of soft tissues, there is often compromised vizualisation of hard tissues (e.g. enamel and cortical bone) due to a low concentration of free hydrogen in solution.\n\n Some progress in better visualizing select hard tissue components of the dentomaxillofacial complex has been reported. Different approaches for the display of dental hard tissues were documented in vitro using specialized single-point imaging (SPI) [8] , ultra-short echo time (UTE) [9] , or zero echo time sequences (ZTE) [9, 10] to adequately detect caries lesions, cracks/fracture of tooth structure, and pulp morphology. The in vivo application of standard MRI sequences in combination with dedicated intraoral coils allowed imaging of a region of multiple teeth, but focused on internal and surface anatomy for caries detection and overview projections [11] [12] [13] . The detailed display of bone, the neurovascular bundle and other soft-tissue components was not feasible [11] or not elaborated on in previous studies [12, 13] .

This could be evaluated further in dedicated studies.\n\n The purpose of this trial was to assess if ZES implantation, followed by a shorter than the currently recommended course of DAPT, on the basis of the patient's clinical profile (tailored DAPT) and independent of stent type, would decrease the incidence of 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in uncertain DES recipients, including those with high bleeding or thrombotic risk and those with low restenosis risk, compared with BMS.\n\n STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION.

The secretion of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are stimulated by excessive myocardial stretch [27] . Therefore we assessed BNP and ANP mRNA levels in the irradiated LV by qPCR. HIR lead to increased ANP and BNP mRNA, which appeared to be lowered by captopril treatment, albeit not significantly ( Supplementary Fig. S3A and B) . (G) Early cardiopulmonary dysfunction was assessed by increase in breathing rate (BR). LIR induces increased BR; captopril treatment did not affect BR. LHIR enhanced BR increase compared to LIR, and captopril attenuated early radiation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction in LHIR.

Therefore, we next investigated the effect of captopril on cardiopulmonary dysfunction early after irradiation using our non-invasive heart and lung interaction rat model.\n\n We measured BR as a measure of cardiopulmonary function in rats irradiated on the heart, lung, both heart and lung, and treated the animals with captopril including a sham-treated group (see Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Captopril treatment following administration of 50% 20 Gy lung irradiation (LIR) (Supplementary Fig. S1C ) resulted in a BR increase of 40 breaths per minute (bpm) at 6-8 weeks postirradiation that was similar to the sham-treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S5 ) and as previously described [10] . Indeed, analysis of the area under the curve of the BR increase from week 0 to 8 after irradiation indicated (Fig. 1G ) that captopril did not influence the control and radiation-induced BR increase after LIR.\n\n Next, we investigated the effect of ACE inhibition on BR after cardiac irradiation. As observed in our previous experiments, HIR does not significantly affect the BR nor does HIR with captopril treatment (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. S5B ). However, after combined heart and 50% lung irradiation (LHIR) (see Supplementary Fig. S1B ), captopril significantly reduced the enhanced BR observed after untreated LHIR ( Fig. 1G and Supplementary  Fig. S5B ). As such, the enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction after inclusion of the heart in the irradiation field was completely diminished after captopril treatment leading to a BR level comparable to the LIR animals. In summary, captopril only ameliorates radiation-induced BR increase when the heart is co-irradiated.\n\n Thoracic irradiation leads to structural changes of heart and lungs. Therefore, we assessed the effect of captopril on these structural changes by using our recently developed CT analysis method [25] which is highly sensitive for non-invasive assessment of thoracic structural changes.\n\n Consistent with the improved cardiopulmonary function, the severe structural changes of the heart and lungs observed after LHIR were significantly reduced after captopril treatment ( Fig. 2A  and B) , and again, this was only observed when the heart was co-irradiated. These structural changes are due to, for example, pleural or cardiac effusion, pulmonary edema, infiltration or fibrosis. Therefore, to further investigate how captopril improves cardiopulmonary function and structure, we visually assessed the presence or absence of effusion. After opening the thorax and diaphragm of the animals, no animals from the LIR group but most of the HIR and LHIR animals presented with effusion in their pleural cavity. Moreover, none of the HIR animals treated with captopril showed signs of pleural effusion.

Thus, there is an unmet need for new therapies for the treatment of IBS.\n\n Due to the unsatisfactory result of conventional drug treatment of IBS, the IBS patients pay more attention to complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) modality. [9] Acupuncture, an important part of CAM, has been shown its effectiveness in the treatment of various pain and gastrointestinal disorders, which includes IBS. [10, 11] EA is an advanced version of traditional acupuncture that inserts needles and provides stimulation with the application of electrical pulses instead of hand manipulation, which has promising treatment effect. Several trials have demonstrated EA is effective for the treatment of IBS. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] EA is commonly used in China to treat functional bowel disorders such as IBS. Since IBS is diagnosed based on its clinical symptoms and its pathophysiology is unclear, the mechanism that EA is effective against IBS has not yet been completely ascertained and needs to be further studied. One animal study demonstrated that EA achieves remission of the IBS visceral hypersensitivity by regulating the expression of purinergic receptors in the peripheral and central pathways to improve in gastrointestinal symptoms. [18] In another study, EA at PC 6 was ascertained to have significant reduction to the frequency of transient lower esophageal relaxations (TLESRs) caused by gastric distension in normal cats. [19] In dogs with intestinal motility observed by duplex Doppler sonography, EA at BL27 was reported to decrease the frequency of intestinal movement by 31%. [19] Although managing IBS with EA is common in China, there is still a lack of systematic review to summarize the efficiency of EA in treating IBS. Therefore, it is necessary for this review to investigate the role of EA in the management of IBS. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published which indicated the benefits of EA in treating IBS. Apparently, the update of systematic review and meta-analysis of EA for IBS is an unmet need to evaluate whether the pooled effects of currently available trials show any benefit of EA in improving symptoms or quality of life in patients with IBS.\n\n 2.1.

The concept that these two types of cell-cell contacts are clearly separated in cardiomyocytes has been recently challenged by the proposal of the \"area composita\", demonstrated in the hearts of a variety of species, including humans (Franke et al. 2006 ).\n\n Interestingly, in samples from failing human hearts, a consistent downregulation of connexin-43 expression is not found: in some patients it is reduced, while in others the levels are comparable to those found in non-failing tissue (Pluess and Ehler, manuscript in preparation). At present it is unclear why failing (DCM) cardiomyocytes in humans respond differently to those in mice, but the effects of patient medication on connexin-43 expression cannot be excluded.\n\n We found the general arrangement of sarcomeric proteins to be unaffected in both human and mouse DCM samples. As can be appreciated from the localisation pattern for titin or myomesin shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , the cross-striations resemble those of the controls, i.e. there is not much evidence of dramatic myofibril disarray. Similar to the mouse, reexpression of EH-myomesin was also detected in human DCM hearts (Fig. 4) . Upregulation of the expression of this embryonic isoform was seen in some cardiomyocytes and not Fig. 3 Increased signal for plakoglobin at the intercalated disc of DCM tissue samples. Confocal micrographs of cryosections from non-failing (healthy; NF) control and failing hearts (DCM). The intercalated discs were stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies against plakoglobin (red signal in overlay), the myofibrils were stained with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the titin m8 epitope (green signal in overlay) and the nuclei were visualised with DAPI (blue signal in overlay). An increased width of signal for plakoglobin is apparent at the intercalated discs from tissue samples of different DCM patients compared to tissue from control (healthy) patients (arrowheads). A signal at the lateral edges of the cardiomyocytes can be occasionally detected in DCM (arrow) in others. We made use of a tissue array with different cardiomyopathy samples and stained it for EH-myomesin expression. Analysis of the extent of expression revealed that there was a good correlation between high expression and IDCM and FDCM, but that lower expression of EH-myomesin occurred in HCM and non-failing hearts (Fig. 5) . This makes EH-myomesin a potential marker for DCM. However, it must be noted that EH-myomesin is also expressed in the conduction system of the heart, particularly in the interventricular septum (Meysen et al. 2007 ); therefore it is important to note the location in the ventricle where the samples are taken.\n\n Approximately 25 % of cases of FDCM are caused by truncation of the titin gene (Herman et al. 2012) . Next generation sequencing (NGS) of FDCM in the samples in the Sydney Human Heart Tissue Bank has commenced only Fig. 4 The more extensible, embryonic isoform of the M-band protein myomesin (EH-myomesin) is re-expressed in a cell-autonomous manner in DCM.

The M-bands were stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies against myomesin (red signal in overlay), the EH-myomesin isoform was stained with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the human EH domain (green signal in overlay) and the nuclei were visualised with DAPI (blue signal in overlay). While no green signal can be detected in the healthy human heart, individual cardiomyocytes show a re-expression of EH-myomesin recently, and no results have yet been published. F\u00fcrst et al. (1988) reported a monoclonal antibody (clone T12) against the N-terminal region of titin that recognises an epitope at the edge of the Z-disc, and Obermann et al. (1996) located a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal titin m8 domain at the M-band. In all of the samples we have analysed to date, these two antibodies have revealed clear alterations of titin striations at apparently similar levels of intensity throughout the section (Fig. 6 and unpublished data) .

Most hospitals have combined a subset of these practices into \"ventilator bundles\" that are mandatory for all mechanically ventilated patients and sometimes all critically ill patients. Typical bundle elements include elevation of the head of the bed, routine oral care with chlorhexidine, daily sedative interruptions, daily assessment of readiness to extubate, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Bundles vary broadly, however, from hospital to hospital [1] .\n\n Despite the popularity and broad penetration of ventilator bundles, the evidence supporting each bundle component is highly variable. Some components, such as routine sedative interruptions and daily assessments of readiness to extubate, have been well studied and consistently associated with better outcomes [2] [3] [4] [5] . Other components, such as headof-bed elevation, have only been assessed in few patients [6, 7] . Finally, there are many successful interventions to prevent pneumonia that are not part of most hospitals' bundles [8] .\n\n A systematic review and meta-analysis in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases helpfully summarizes some of the vast literature on preventing hospital-acquired pneumonia and provides some clarity about the relative value of different interventions. Roquilly and colleagues identified 157 randomized controlled trials evaluating more than 20 different interventions. They conducted a series of meta-analyses to determine the impact of each intervention. The investigators selected hospital mortality as their primary outcome rather than hospital-acquired pneumonia. Of the 20 interventions studied, the only measure associated with a decrease in hospital mortality was selective digestive decontamination with regimens that included systemic antimicrobials (relative risk, 0.78, 95% confidence interval, .69-.89). Patient positioning, subglottic secretion drainage, closed suctioning systems, probiotics, early tracheotomy, early enteral feeding, stress ulcer prophylaxis, silver-coated endotracheal tubes, oral decontamination with antiseptics or antibiotics, selective digestive decontamination without systemic antimicrobial therapy, and all the other interventions studied had no impact on mortality.\n\n These provocative findings are a shot over the bow of infection prevention and quality improvement programs. This meta-analysis simultaneously challenges the validity of current ventilator bundles and begs the question why selective digestive decontamination with systemic antimicrobials is not routinely employed?\n\n In truth, evidence has been gathering for years that the classic ventilator bundle merits revision. Some bundle components, such as stress ulcer prophylaxis, paradoxically increase pneumonia risk [9] . Other bundle components, such as routine oral care with chlorhexidine, do not clearly prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia and may even increase mortality risk [10, 11] .\n\n A major challenge in pneumonia prevention science is the subjectivity and poor specificity of clinical criteria to define pneumonia [12, 13] . Subjectivity allows for the possibility that lower pneumonia rates in the treatment arms of open-label studies are due to observer bias. Poor specificity allows for the possibility that some of the decreases in pneumonia rates in both open-label and double-blind studies are due to less colonization rather than less pneumonia [14] .\n\n These challenges are the reasons why Roquilly and colleagues selected mortality as their primary outcome rather than hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other workers have reached similar conclusions [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America and Infectious Disease Society of America's latest revision of their compendium of strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia specifically prioritizes interventions associated with less time to extubation, shorter intensive care stays, lower hospital mortality, less antibiotic prescribing, and/ or lower costs over interventions associated with lower ventilator-associated pneumonia rates alone [17] . The compendium recommends using noninvasive mechanical ventilation whenever possible, minimizing sedation, interrupting sedatives and assessing readiness to extubate daily, mobilizing patients early, using endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage, changing ventilator circuits only if visibly soiled or malfunctioning, and elevating the head of the bed.\n\n This bundle of recommendations is different and more extensive than those suggested by the meta-analysis by Roquilly and colleagues. There are 2 reasons for this. First, the compendium authors evaluated some interventions that were not considered by Roquilly and colleagues such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, minimizing sedation, daily sedative interruptions, and daily assessment of readiness to extubate. Second, the compendium authors found merit in interventions associated with less time to extubation, shorter lengths-ofstay, less antibiotic prescribing, and/or lower costs in addition to those associated with lower mortality rates. This is important, partly because these are additional clinically meaningful outcomes, and partly because the amount of evidence supporting different interventions varies considerably.", "qa": [["30_26262179_0_1", "What are some of the components typically included in ventilator bundles for preventing hospital-acquired pneumonia?\n", "Some components typically included in ventilator bundles for preventing hospital-acquired pneumonia are elevation of the head of the bed, routine oral care with chlorhexidine, daily sedative interruptions, daily assessment of readiness to extubate, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

It features regulated changes in cell shape and surface adhesion within the context of a dimorphic cell cycle that culminates in asymmetric cell division ( Figure 1 ).\n\n Caulobacter's cell cycle allows easy synchronization of populations based on developmental stage, and cells display clear polarity that distinguishes their two ends. These properties facilitate spatiotemporal tracking of gene expression, protein subcellular localization, chromosome segregation, and growth over the course of Caulobacter's life cycle. This has enabled detailed understanding not only of the mechanisms of bacterial differentiation and development, but also of widely conserved processes in chromosome replication and cell cycle regulation that were less tractable in symmetrically dividing model species such as Escherichia coli.\n\n The cell cycle of Caulobacter is a visually striking display of bacterial development, with each life stage having a distinctive appearance (Figure 1 ). Major functional transitions accompany the morphological changes of the cell as it progresses through the cell cycle. The newborn swarmer cell is equipped with a flagellum and pili at a single pole. Incapable of DNA replication, the swarmer cell dedicates its energy towards motility and dispersal. With time, the flagellar pole of the swarmer cell undergoes differentiation. It secretes a polysaccharide adhesin known as the holdfast, which\n\n mediates permanent surface attachment of the cell. Then the flagellum and pili are lost from that pole and replaced by the growing stalk, which is a thin extension of the cell envelope. The stalked cell is reproductively mature and gives off daughter swarmer cells, marking the completion of the dimorphic life cycle.\n\n How are the events of the Caulobacter life cycle coordinated so precisely? First of all, Caulobacter tightly regulates DNA replication initiation, allowing it to occur exactly once per cell cycle in the stalked stage. Overseeing this important routine is a protein called CtrA, which belongs to the response regulator family of transcription factors. CtrA not only prevents extraneous initiation of DNA replication, it also controls the expression and activity of a large number of important regulons involved in cell cycle progression. CtrA prevents the initiation of new rounds of DNA replication by binding to the chromosomal origin of replication; however, it undergoes timed degradation during the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition. This allows replication initiation and tightly coupled activation of various pathways involved in polar differentiation, growth and cell division, maintaining synchrony between the various events of the cell cycle. The activity of CtrA and its effectors marks the crucial transition that enables the emergence of complex development from the mechanistic foundations of functionally symmetric binary fission, in Caulobacter and other related organisms. The details of the functioning of this pathway therefore continue to be an extensive area of research in developmental microbiology.\n\n Caulobacter's division gives rise to two cell types with distinct developmental fates -how does this occur? Polarity in CtrA regulation between the two halves of the dividing cell drives developmental asymmetry between Caulobacter's two daughter cell types. CtrA is synthesized and activated in the stalked cell shortly after DNA replication initiation. As the stalked cell progresses towards division, two important regulatory proteins, the histidine kinases DivJ and PleC, localize to opposite poles of the cell (Figure 1 ). At the stalked pole, DivJ signaling favors localization, degradation, and inactivation of CtrA. Conversely, at the pole opposite the stalk, PleC signaling promotes the dispersal and activity of CtrA. When both are present in the elongating stalked cell, PleC's effect dominates and CtrA remains active. But upon cell constriction at the predivisional stage, the two daughter cell compartments differentially inherit either DivJ or PleC. In the stalked compartment, DivJ signaling abolishes CtrA activity, allowing immediate initiation of a new round of DNA replication and growth in the stalked daughter. Conversely, in the swarmer compartment, PleC signaling maintains CtrA activity, which continues to inhibit differentiation and DNA replication until its timed degradation. Thus, differential localization of regulatory proteins at the two ends of the pre-divisional cell drives developmental asymmetry between the daughter cells of Caulobacter's division.\n\n But why does a bacterium need such a complex cell cycle? The French biologist Fran\u00e7ois Jacob once said that the dream of a cell is to become two cells. Indeed, many rapidly growing bacteria like E. coli initiate several simultaneous rounds of DNA replication per cell cycle in preparation for multiple successive divisions.", "qa": [["78_26837650_0_1", "How does Caulobacter regulate DNA replication initiation during its cell cycle?\n", "Caulobacter tightly regulates DNA replication initiation by using a protein called CtrA, which prevents extraneous initiation of DNA replication and controls the expression and activity of important regulons involved in cell cycle progression.

This stage occurs following delivery, due to a dramatic decrease in progesterone, removal of milk from the breast and maintenance of prolactin levels. 10, 11 In term mothers, this stage generally begins by 30 to 48 h following delivery. 10 Delay in achievement of lactogenesis stage II is common in all mothers, with 22 to 31% of women entering this stage after 72 h following delivery. 12, 13 Delay has been associated with decreased success in later lactation in mothers of term infants.\n\n 14 Preterm delivery and a delay in breastfeeding have also been associated with later onset of lactogenesis stage II. 10, 15, 16 Mothers of preterm infants who experience delayed attainment of this stage have demonstrated decreased milk volumes at 24 h after birth. 17 If a delay is associated with inadequate volume of breast milk for feeding, breast milk may be replaced with formula or initiation of enteral feedings may be delayed.\n\n Insufficient milk supply is commonly cited by mothers of VLBW infants as the reason they elect to discontinue breastfeeding their infants. 18 Breast milk volume is correlated with gestational age, so mothers of VLBW infants have a strong tendency to produce significantly less milk than mothers of term infants. 19, 20 Milk production in mothers delivering prematurely may be adversely affected by decreased mammary gland development and decreased exposure to prolactin, cortisol and other hormones that occur during a full-term pregnancy. 15 In term infants, maintenance of lactation is dependent on suckling frequency and intensity. 21 Due to developmental, physiologic and gastrointestinal immaturity, VLBW infants are unable to feed directly from the breast, so mothers must artificially express breast milk to feed their infants. 22 Artificial forms of milk expression may not effectively emulate the sucking mechanics of breastfeeding, potentially limiting maintenance of lactation, and causing a delay in lactogenesis stage II.\n\n Earlier initiation of the first feeding at the breast and duration of breastfeeding have been associated with several studies' results, indicating that a delay of over 1 to 1.5 h was related to shorter breastfeeding duration. [23] [24] [25] Timing of initial breastfeeding following term delivery has been shown to correlate with milk volume on day 5, and a delay in initial breastfeeding has been shown to delay lactogenesis stage II in term infants. 13 Earlier initiation of milk expression has also been associated with increased milk volume in mothers of VLBW infants. [26] [27] [28] [29] Unfortunately, mothers of VLBW infants often delay milk expression for hours to days following delivery. In an observational study, Hill et al. 30 found that the mean delay in initiation of milk expression was 34 h in mothers of VLBW infants. Studies assessing the association of initiation timing and milk volume showed a wide discrepancy in timing of initial expression, which often began over 24 h following delivery. The earliest expression initiation was reported by Furman et al., 26 who found initiation prior to 6 h following delivery was positively associated with prolonged lactation over 40 weeks' postmenstrual age. These researchers, however, did not assess the effect of initiation timing on milk volume or lactogenesis stage II. Studies examining the association of milk expression within the first hour following delivery and milk volume in mothers of VLBW infants are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of our randomized pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of initiation of milk expression p60 min, compared with initiation between 1 and 6 h, following delivery in mothers of VLBW infants.", "qa": [["22_1656779_0_1", "What are the potential benefits of providing breast milk to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants?\n", "Providing breast milk to VLBW infants has been shown to significantly decrease morbidity associated with prematurity, including feeding intolerance, late onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

A suspected case was defined as someone who fulfilled the country-specific epidemiological and clinical criteria but was not tested at the time of data collection for this analysis (England 29/07/2009 , France 20/10/2009 , all suspected cases were tested in the other countries).\n\n Data on confirmed cases were used including information on: date of reporting, date of illness onset, travel to an at-risk country within the last 7 days prior to illness onset, gender and age where available. In the UK only data from England were available for this analysis, although Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales had similar epidemic patterns in the summer of 2009 (Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Northern Ireland; Health Protection Scotland; National Public Health Service for Wales).\n\n Due to the absence of any data on the date of illness onset in Luxembourg we assumed the reporting delay to be either zero or 1 day (equally likely). For all other countries the country-specific reporting-delay distribution was obtained by fitting a gamma distribution to the observed data ( Figure S1 ) and this was used for imputing the date of illness onset for cases with only data available on the date of report: for the calculation of the effective reproduction number (the number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case during its infectious period-\"R\") sampling from this distribution for cases with unknown infection date was included in the bootstrap and for all other analysis such a case was divided across possible dates proportionally to the distribution. For the few cases with unknown importation status, this value was imputed (included in the bootstrap for the calculation of R and divided amongst imported/indigenous proportionally for all other analysis) using the weekly likelihoods of a case being imported, calculated from the information available. For the weeks without any information the likelihood from the previous week was assumed, starting at week 1 with 100% imported.\n\n The effective reproduction number was calculated from the laboratory confirmed cases by an extended version of a method described by Wallinga and Teunis (2004) which uses the serial interval to assign a most likely source case for each case that was not imported and therefore estimates the average number of secondary cases caused by an individual (effective reproduction number). This included a correction for censoring as well as bootstrapping with resampling the unavailable data on importation status and date of illness onset. The serial interval distribution employed was constructed through artificial count data of 1,4,7,6,4,2,1,1 observations (representing weights) of a serial interval of length 0 to 7 days respectively. It was inspired by unpublished early estimates of the serial interval in the UK to follow a gamma distribution with mean of 3.88 days, variance of 2.77 days and an offset of 1 day (this estimate was slightly refined later to a mean of 2.51 days and a variance of 1.55 days without offset (Ghani et al., 2009) ). To test for a difference between the R estimates of England compared to the other countries we examined the overlap between the confidence intervals, which is a rather conservative test (Schenker and Gentleman, 2001) . To avoid setting up multiple data-sharing agreements, program code (written in R version 2.11.0) was distributed to each country to perform the analysis on its own data. Outputs from the program code were shared and analysed centrally.\n\n \n\n The probability of an outbreak of A(H1N1)v in a susceptible homogenously mixed population becoming extinct (extinction probability) was approximated by a branching process (Karlin and Taylor, 1975) .", "qa": [["23_25540935_1_1", "What are the criteria for defining a confirmed case of A(H1N1)v influenza?\n", "A confirmed case of A(H1N1)v influenza is defined as having a positive laboratory test by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, or showing a fourfold rise in influenza A(H1N1)v specific neutralizing antibody titre from a convalescent to an acute sample.

Some exercise studies on T1D subjects consider carbohydrate supplement 30 , reduction of preprandial insulin doses 31 , and adjustment of basal insulin infusion in pump therapy 32 . Other studies suggest to perform intermittent, very brief (about 10 s) maximal intensity sprints either at the beginning 33 or at the end 34 of a moderate intensity exercise session: the hypoglycemia would be attenuated by a transient reduction of glucose disposal 35 . Another strategy would consist in performing resistance exercise prior to aerobic physical activity 36 . On the contrary, hyperglycemic episodes may occur following strenuous exercise; in this case, a small bolus of a short-acting insulin analog is suggested, or, for insulin pump users, basal insulin infusion may be temporarily increased to restore euglycemic levels 34 . At the end of this 3-month observational period, hyperglycemic events significantly diminished with respect to baseline in the ACT group, despite a putative stress due to exercise; this could be interpreted as another cue of a well-controlled monitoring system. Besides, ACT patients, compared to SED ones, seemed to have a more responsible behavior in the monitoring of glucose levels, as witnessed by a favorable ratio between boli and doses of infused insulin.\n\n At the hospital outpatient clinic and in the exercise physiology laboratory, counseling sessions were successfully offered to both groups in the management of the disease. Therefore, an educational program addressed to T1D patients focused on insulin injection monitoring, diet and exercise are strongly recommended. As suggested by our indications, especially SED patients may benefit from an augmented level of exercise habits by following the exercise staff recommendations.\n\n The main limitation of this study is the small sample size. An interventional study would have possibly allowed to detect significant differences between groups in some features (HbA1c, insulin doses, and lipid profiles). However, we think that this snapshot is still informative within the T1D scenario. Likely, our findings, even if limited, can be attributed to the different physical activity levels. Greater changes rather than tendencies might be gathered with a controlled exercise trial. As such, these observations may be meant as primary predictors of the exercise-induced metabolic improvements in T1D subjects. Future studies should address whether exercise training may impact also on autoimmunity beyond inflammatory pattern in individuals affected by T1D or pre-T1D.\n\n This study highlights that exercise is an independent factor for better metabolic profiles in T1D individuals on insulin pump therapy. Integrated monitoring systems (CSII plus CGM) along with an educational-based approach are efficient in gaining the beneficial effects of exercise in the management of T1D. Further interventional studies are advocated for investigating a positive exercise-induced immunomodulation.
