Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Anatomical and clinical studies have contributed extensively to the development of new surgical approaches, while new imaging tools have significantly increased the accuracy of preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of our patients. Finally, the concept of cooperation between multidisciplinary teams was adopted for the treatment of these tumors allowing complete eradication of large tumors involving the skull base and craniofacial regions.\n\n When tumors arising in the anterior skull base invade both soft and hard tissues of the skull base, tumor resection may create extensive skull base defects and produce a free conduit between the paranasal sinuses and the intracranial space. Following tumor extirpation, skull base cranial base defects require precise and durable reconstruction to (1) form a watertight dural seal, (2) provide a barrier between the contaminated sinonasal space and the sterile subdural compartment, (3) prevent airflow into the intracranial space, (4) maintain a functional sinonasal system, and (5) provide a good cosmetic outcome.\n\n A variety of approaches have been developed to accomplish these goals. A split calvarial bone graft, hydroxyapatite paste, or titanium mesh may be utilized for bony reconstruction. Autologous flaps (pericranial or galeal flaps) and artificial substitutions are often used for reconstruction of the skull base. Unfortunately, these methods bear significant disadvantages. Local flaps are often insufficient in size for reliable restoration of extensive anterior skull base defects. 1 Synthetic substitutions of dura and bone can induce chronic inflammation, carry high risk of infection, and are inferior to biological sources in terms of strength and sealing quality. 2 Recent progress in microvascular and surgical techniques has enabled the development and implementation of free tissue transfer. Following skull base resection, free flaps may be used for massive defects, with excellent surgical results and low complication rates. 1, 3, 4 Free tissue transfer is, however, a relatively complex surgical procedure that requires high technical qualifications. Another drawback of this method is the bulk of the muscular free flap, which may mask local recurrence and make radiological follow-up more difficult. 5 Auto grafts, such as fascia lata and temporalis fascia, had been used in the past for skull base reconstruction, but they were usually covered with a vascularized flap (i.e., free muscular flaps, pericranial or galeal flaps), assuming that an overlying vascular tissue is essential to preserve long-term viability of the fascial graft. 6 In any situation, failure to create adequate reconstruction harbors significant complications, among them cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, brain herniation, and tension pneumocephalus. 7 Although the subcranial or craniofacial approaches have become established procedures for management of anterior skull base tumors, 8 surgeons commonly use combinations of methods to accomplish satisfactory anterior skull base reconstruction. Thus, there is no single gold standard technique that is both simple and reliable for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with anterior cranial base operations.\n\n Here we present a large series of patients who had undergone extirpation of tumors via the subcranial approach followed by reconstruction of anterior skull base defects. We present a reliable and reproducible algorithm for cranial base reconstruction, with low rates of intra-and extracranial complications. We describe the healing process of the double-layer free fascial grafts and provide evidence to show that long-term viability of the fascia is achievable without an overlying vascularized flap.\n\n This retrospective study was based on a review of the hospital charts and the outpatient clinical and radiological data of 120 consecutive cases operated between 1994 and 2005. All the resections and reconstructions were performed by means of the subcranial approach to the anterior skull base.\n\n Sixty-four males and 56 females aged 2 to 81 years (mean 42 years) were enrolled into this study. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by a head and neck surgeon, a plastic surgeon, and a neurosurgeon.

Asked for their concrete criticisms they first reported weakness of PRISCUS list in general, and, after repeating the question, they apologized for not remembering since they do not use the list. There were two FPs knowing nothing of PRISCUS and PIM at all. This is similar to results of other studies describing educational lacks in primary care as well as hospital physicians, regarding appropriate prescribing in elderly patients [20, 21] .\n\n Most reported cause for PIM prescription was the statement of unavoidability of PIM because having no alternatives in medication, especially in multimorbid patients. FPs prescribing PIM appreciated the related higher risk for unexpected medication-related events and reported to re-consult these patients in shorter periods.\n\n Regarding polypharmacy, there are no convincing recommendations as to what to prescribe as an alternative. Full stop. That is why I consult these patients (note: with PIM) closely. I will see them several times in the quarter at my practice to keep a close eye on them.\n\n [FP2]\n\n (Note: As with PIM) you have similar issues with these huge amounts of pain pellets or patients receiving Falithrom (note: Phenprocoumon). Every time something can happen. But this is unavoidable, isn't it? [FP5] Further arguments are related to FPs' prioritization regarding therapeutic objectives. There are stronger patient-related factors than age that influence their decision of a certain medication. Based on this, the PIMtopic could become less important:\n\n If you keep the wellbeing of the patient as the primary goal in mind, then a lot will be sorted based on this prioritization. Age seems to be a difficult criterion in general, so patients' health status and perspectives should be more important. [FP2] Regarding sedatives, benzodiazepine vs. z-drugs it is like being caught between a rock and a hard place. I am certain that it (note: PIM) is not recommended by PRISCUS but there are no alternatives. And the patient needs to get sleep and be pain-free from time to time. So we talk to the patient about the medication, how to limit it time-wise and how to monitor it closely.\n\n [FP1] Own bad experiences regarding a) change of medication to avoid PIM and b) refusal of following prescription of sedatives/hypnotics (that also belong to PIM if certain dosage is reached) to addicted patients resulted in a kind of resignation.\n\n You can start making changes in medication, yes, but most of them are not successful. [FP1] In context of FPs' care for patients who are addicted to hypnotics, PIM-topic seemed to become subordinated whereas treatment of addiction got into the main focus:\n\n Well, you can speak like a priest in the church: if patients have a certain level of addiction it is really difficult. I could refuse them the medication, but then they will go to a different [physician] , so this doesn't make any sense.\n\n This finding is convenient to our previous result of the logistic regression (see above), showing that a documented mental disorder was the strongest predictor for prescription of PIM.\n\n Most of the interviewed FPs described the advantages of caring primarily for patients addicted to hypnotics because getting them under control in \"one hand\". But finally they seem to be still perplexed:\n\n I had special cases of patients, when I said, okay, let's keep them in \"one hand\" and see if we can somehow take responsibility for it. Yes, we try to care for them individually. Last time I had a patient, she picked up sleeping pills from her neurologist, from me and from another GP. And then at night she had a bad fall because she was just completely in the swash. Finally she was hospitalized, but how to manage her? I have no magic remedy for this problem.\n\n Most of the FPs described the importance of close cooperation with neurologists/psychiatrists regarding care for patients addicted to hypnotics, but several problems were pointed out. First, they reported patients' difficulties to get access to a psychiatrist for \"just\" sleeping disorders and second, they reported communication lacks regarding prescriptions of medications and lacks in referral of clinical information. And third, some of the FPs pointed out an uncritical prescribing by psychiatrists without looking at the patient in their entirety including existing multimorbidity. But especially in the case of out-patient detoxification, FPs underlined the necessity of cooperation. To summarize, most of the FPs saw great challenges and chances in a better cooperation with psychiatrists to improve medical care for (elderly) patients addicted to hypnotics.\n\n This is to our best knowledge the first published study triangulating PIM prescription data based on the analysis of patients' records with qualitative interview data regarding case-related motives of PIM prescription. In summary, prescription of PIM was mainly a topic of chronic disease treatment. We find out that it is essential to see FPs in a complex decision making situation with several influencing factors on their prescribing, including:\n\n 1) patient-oriented prioritization reflecting i.e. multimorbidity and related polypharmacy, existing mental disorders, gender, patients' requests [29] and experiences 2) FPs' experiences in daily practice [29] regarding e.g.\n\n (inter) actions of drugs [31] , reactions of patients in case of refusal or change of a drug 3) FPs' knowledge regarding e.g. existing evidence/ recommendations and their trust in it 4) dependent on quality of cooperation with in-and out-patient specialist; forwarded information regarding clinical indication and prescribed drugs 5) organizational characteristics, i.e. lack of time in daily practice, follow-up prescriptions of PIM initially prescribed by specialists.\n\n Obviously, there is a problem with the applicability of guidelines and recommendations, rooted in the special characteristics of FPs\u00b4work: the individual consideration of decisions against the background of the knowledge of the patient's medical history, patient\u00b4s characteristics and suspected adherence.\n\n Partly, FPs reported to be not really convinced of their decisions foreseeing associated higher risks of drug related adverse events. Assuming that they will not find medication alternatives for individual multimorbid patients, frequently re-consultations and laboratory tests were seen as methods to detect drug related problems as soon as possible.\n\n The partly detected education lack regarding PIM and PRISCUS shows challenges for further educational tasks that should take the partly missing trust in recommendation and PRISCUS into account even though influence of new guidelines and their recommendations on physicians' daily practice seems to be limited [29] .\n\n Abbreviations FP, family practitioner; PIM, potentially inappropriate medication; PRISCUS, PRerequISites for a new health Care model for elderly people with mUltiple morbiditieS", "qa": [["59_18431715_4_1", "What are some factors that influence family practitioners' decision-making when prescribing potentially inappropriate medications (PIM)?", "Factors that influence family practitioners' decision-making when prescribing PIM include patient-oriented prioritization (such as multimorbidity and polypharmacy), experiences in daily practice (such as drug interactions and patient reactions), knowledge of existing evidence/recommendations, quality of cooperation with specialists, and organizational characteristics (such as lack of time and follow-up prescriptions).

The performance of this test was regarded as an evidence of the individual's degree of discriminability and as a means of winning the child's confidence. Three trials were given with a limit of five minutes on any single trial. At the end of this time, if the child had failed, he was instructed in the solution of the problem, which could then on subsequent (180) The regular grade children, forty-three in number, present a very different picture, practically the same sort of social background and environment, but another type of child. In only one case is there a pronounced stigma which immediately marks the child as abnormal. To the more careful observer, the groups of suspects, as a whole, might present a picture of lack of alertness and slow comprehension, but at a casual glance they are an ordinary group of school children, chosen at random. Within the group of fortythree children nearly every type of school problem is represented; lack of energy due to poor physical condition, language deficiency due to the use of a foreign tongue in the home, lack of comprehension of school work due to an intellectual deficiency, problems of discipline and motivation, and poor school progress as a result of inadequate teaching in fundamentals. Our problem with these children was not merely to determine their levels, but to make some suggestion to the school principal as to a method of dealing with the case in order to benefit both the child and the school.\n\n A result which should be obtained if the system of school promotion is practically applied, is evident from the fact that the number of children considered backward or retarded, decreased in the higher grades. The supposition is that the backward children have been eliminated in the lower grades, and not permitted to hold up the progress of the pupils in the upper grades.\n\n In the first A and B grades, seventeen children were tested, the largest total number in any grade. In grades 2A and 2B, eight children were suspects, ranging from seven years eight months to ten years two months.\n\n The group of nine children in grades 3A and 3B varied from nine years five months to thirteen years seven months. In grades 4A, 5B, 6A, 6B, only eight children were tested with ages from twelve years six months to fifteen years two months.\n\n Within each group there is a spread of at least three years in age. This variation immediately presents a problem in dealing with these suspects. Even on the supposition that the school were able to remove these children, from the grades where they are now, in the hope that with special teaching they would cease to be misfits in their grades, the ten-year-old child, for instance, who is getting along smoothly in the second grade is still a misfit. He is at least two years retarded in school proficiency, but in most cases not retarded physically or socially. He is bigger and has more energy at his disposal than the seven-year-old who belongs in this grade. The ten-year-old's longer experience of life, since the years from seven to ten are so full of new sensations and emotions, has made him more mature. Thus the teacher who has the problem of dealing with a retarded ten-year-old and the seven-year-old, in the same class, has a distinct difficulty merely from the point of view of age difference.\n\n In our suggestions to the principal therefore, we were obliged to take into account the practical solution of the difficulty from the standpoint of age as well as deficiency.\n\n The intelligence quotients varied from 58.8 to 127. In general it may be said that the intelligence quotient correlated fairly well with the memory span and grade level tests, although these intellectual explorations sometimes differed radically from the estimates formed through the performance tests. In the first grade, five out of seven children examined failed the eight year comprehension tests. This group as a whole seemed unusually well oriented socially considering the poor school proficiency. In the vocabulary tests at the higher ages certain mistakes were prevalent; for instance, almost all the children gave the meaning for \"election\" when asked to define \"lecture.\" In very few cases did they know the meaning of \"civil\" or \"ramble\" and in almost every case they gave the correct explanation of the word \"insure.\" Whenever they did not know the meaning of a word, if it could be misunderstood through mispronunciation, they misinterpreted it; for example, \"gallon\" for \"gown\" and \"Alfred\" for \"outward,\"", "qa": [["62_5229439_0_1", "What are some factors that can contribute to poor school progress in children?\n", "Factors that can contribute to poor school progress in children include lack of energy due to poor physical condition, language deficiency due to the use of a foreign tongue in the home, lack of comprehension of school work due to an intellectual deficiency, problems of discipline and motivation, and inadequate teaching in fundamentals."], ["62_5229439_0_2", "How does age difference impact the education of children with different levels of proficiency?\n", "Age difference can present a challenge in the education of children with different levels of proficiency.

Some patients find nasal sponges more comfortable than traditional cannulae, while others find them less comfortable. They have a tendency to fall out, so may be best taped to clothing or to the patient's skin.\n\n Face masks can be variable performance or fixed performance (Figure 3) . Like nasal oxygen, variable performance masks deliver a set number of litres/ minute of 100 per cent oxygen, to which a variable amount of air is added, depending on depth of breathing. Although variable performance masks supply a guide to average percentages, these are only approximations.\n\n Fixed performance masks supply accurate per- centages of oxygen, provided the correct flow of oxygen is used. This accuracy is achieved using a Venturi system -a fine jet of oxygen that draws air in, rather as the wake of a speedboat draws in water. Air inlets in the nozzle allow a fixed amount of air to enter, diluting the oxygen to a large volume with a precise concentration. The large volume ensures that practically the entire breath is from this accurate mixture.\n\n Where absolute accuracy of percentage oxygen is desirable, fixed performance masks should be used. This is likely to be for relatively long-term (more than one day) use, or with patients who have chronic respiratory disease. Variable performance masks are cheaper, and where oxygen therapy is likely to be limited to a few hours, or where absolute accuracy is not essential, with therapy being adjusted according to frequently monitored saturation, their use is usually justified. However, low flow rates of variable performance masks can cause carbon dioxide accumulation in the masks (Beaumont 2000), worsening carbon dioxide retention in chronic respiratory disease. Many wards consider, justifiably, that stocking two different types of masks creates a clinical risk, so limit stock to one type. If only one type is stocked, fixed performance masks are recommended. (Figure 4 ). Thirty-one per cent oxygen (orange) is almost never needed, so very few areas stock these nozzles. The large gap between 60 per cent and 40 per cent is potentially problematic -reducing oxygen delivery from 60 per cent currently necessitates reducing oxygen concentration by one third. Some manufacturers are therefore considering developing a 50 per cent nozzle.\n\n Cold water humidifiers (connected to 'elephant' tubing) have Venturi valves, making them fixed performance systems.\n\n Standard face masks can only deliver up to 60 per cent oxygen. For acute, severe oxygen need, a 'reservoir' bag mask ( Figure 5 ) delivers nearly 100 per cent oxygen. These are useful in emergency situations (such as cardiac arrest), but should not be used for long periods (more than a few hours at most), as high concentrations (more than 60 per cent for longer than 24 hours) can be toxic.\n\n Inaccurate settings of oxygen flow will cause inaccurate delivery. With all types of mask, it is important to check the litres set on the oxygen flow metre (or cylinder). Oxygen flow should be read from the centre of the float.\n\n Breathing is stimulated by three chemicals in blood: \u25a0 (high) carbon dioxide \u25a0 (low) oxygen \u25a0 acid (pH <7.35). In health, all three stimulate breathing, but because chronic respiratory disease often causes chronically high levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and acids, people with chronic respiratory disease may breathe solely in response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). In people with chronic respiratory disease, giving supplementary oxygen can remove the stimulus to breathe. This has created the mistaken but widespread belief that people with chronic respiratory disease should never be given more than 28 per cent oxygen.\n\n Bateman and Leach's classic medical review (1998) suggests that only 10 to 15 per cent of people with chronic respiratory disease are at risk of respiratory depression if given more than 28 per cent oxygen. So 85 to 90 per cent of people with chronic respiratory disease are potentially denied sufficient oxygen to protect 10 to 15 per cent of their population. Political manifestos advocating this balance would be untenable, yet every day health care applies these odds to people with chronic respiratory disease. Oxygen is vital for life. If people need more than 28 per cent oxygen, they should be given what they need.\n\n In emergency situations (such as cardiac arrest), \n\n Oxygen is a dry gas, so will collect moisture from any moist surface. At 20\u00b0C (average room temperature in the UK), air is 50 per cent saturated (Ballard et al 1992) . This means that it can hold as much moisture again as it already contains. Warmer air can hold more water. Normally, by the time air reaches the bronchi, it has been warmed to body temperature, and fully saturated.", "qa": [["11_479249_1_1", "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using nasal sponges for oxygen therapy compared to traditional cannulae?", "Nasal sponges may be more comfortable for some patients, but they have a tendency to fall out and may need to be taped to clothing or the patient's skin.

There are no reports about novel polymorphisms found in Hispanics as far as we know.\n\n Currently, a few ongoing international efforts in this field (e.g., the 1,000 Genomes Project) are recruiting individuals of Hispanic heritage (i.e., Colombians, MexicanAmericans, and Puerto Ricans), becoming an invaluable resource for gaining knowledge about the frequency and distribution of common genetic variants in these often marginally represented minority populations, thus bridging the gap of information between white Caucasians and these ethnically diverse groups. In addition, some independent studies of relatively small sample sizes have been conducted by a limited number of researchers. However, there are still quite a few issues that need to be addressed before making significant progress in the field with regard to the inclusion of Hispanics for a proper pharmacogenetic ascertainment. Some of these concerns are highlighted below.\n\n The first and most important point to consider is the pharmacogenetic variability and the wide range of genetic diversity (i.e., mosaic of ancestries) observed within the Hispanic population. We investigated the population structure of 35 Puerto Ricans using the Hap1M Duo BeadChip\u2122 on Illumina iScan\u2122 by a high-resolution total genome-driven pairwise allelic dissimilarity analysis and compared the result to a randomly selected subset of a US reference population from Kentucky (30 Caucasians and 10 African-Americans). It can be seen clearly that the reference population is segregated into two distinct groups ( Figure 2) . As suspected, all the dark stripes (no. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] in the upper panel belong to individuals who self-identified as African-Americans. It is remarkable how clearly the whole genome array is able to distinguish ethnic origin here. The gradation in In this review article, we reported results from several published studies on Hispanics without a clear definition of their ethnic or geographic origin, which makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions on the relevance of the findings to a certain ethnic group (e.g., Caribbean Hispanics). However, cultural barriers to recruit and retain individuals of Hispanic origin in clinical studies also need further consideration. The label \"Hispanic or Latino\" comprises multiple countries of origin that share the same language and culture and similar habits and history, but they should not be considered as a single monolithic population for pharmacogenetic purposes. Intergroup differences, cryptic population structures, and stratification within the Hispanic population are expected due in part to a differential pattern of ancestral contributions and admixture, but intraethnic differences have also been observed. For example, CYP2C9*3 prevalence is higher in Mexican-Americans than in Mexican-Mestizos and Mexican indigenous Tapehuana [46, 47, 50] . CYP2C9 polymorphisms also showed intraethnic variations among Cuban-Mestizos and Cuban-Whites [54] . Therefore, given the great genetic diversity within Hispanics, we should treat the person as an individual rather than a member of an ethnic group while applying the DNA-guided personalized medicine paradigm in this population [8, 80] .\n\n Considering the high level of admixture and heterogeneity of Hispanics, new methodological approaches should be considered as part of the experimental designs to gain more insight into the clinical relevance of genetic polymorphisms involved in drug responses among these groups. Some of these methods are admixture mapping, pathway analyses, and population-based sequencing. Changes in linkage disequilibrium need to be considered given a distinct population structure that characterizes Hispanics as a consequence of a differential contribution from multiple ancestries; new putative markers or association signals may arise from a unique combination of haplotype blocks.\n\n At present, the majority of the commercially available genotyping platforms include only the most common variants, failing to detect those \"rare\" polymorphisms showing higher prevalence in admixed minority populations [79] . Gonz\u00e1lez-Tejera and coworkers [79] interrogate the CYP2D6 gene for polymorphisms on this locus in Puerto Rican patients who are intolerant to drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Strikingly, two patients carried the rare variant CYP2D6*31, and one has the CYP2D6*40 variant, both of them not included in commercial platforms. The authors also found uncommon combinations of alleles and suggested that the Puerto Rican population is unique and may harbor other alleles less common to other populations [79] .\n\n Pharmacogenetic studies in the admixed Hispanic population should not be limited to ascertain commonly occurring allelic variants. Instead, they should also encompass other less frequent variants that might be either part of multiple causative loci or in extended linkage disequilibrium with functional alleles relevant for drug responses in a certain population. Further studies are warranted to accomplish this major goal. The success of the Personalized Medicine paradigm will depend on our capabilities to recognize the genetic diversity existing between and within different ethnic groups, as well as the uniqueness of their genetic backgrounds [8, 80] .\n\n The material in this review is partially the result of work supported with resources and the use of facilities at the Veteran Affairs Caribbean Health System in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

[2] [3] [4] Most of the clinical signs are neither sensitive nor specific. A clinical hallmark of Wilson's disease is the KF ring, caused by deposition of copper in corneal Descemet's membrane. 2 Hepatic dysfunction can be highly variable, ranging from being asymptomatic with deranged liver function test to compensated or decompensated cirrhosis and acute hepatic failure. Many may present with isolated splenomegaly due to clinically nonevident cirrhosis with portal hypertension, as in our case.\n\n In pregnancy hepatic dysfunction may due to pregnancy-specific complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum, pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Changes in maternal physiology such as hyper-estrogenemia may lead to changes in the biochemical parameters which are affected by Wilson's disease, and this also makes the diagnosis difficult. A diagnostic scoring system based on clinical signs and biochemical investigations was proposed by a working party at the International Meeting on Wilson's Disease, Leipzig, 2001 . 5 Since these include non-specific signs/symptoms and the results may be altered due to the pregnant state, its accuracy and usefulness in diagnosing a pregnant woman with Wilson's disease is unknown. However, in a pregnant woman presenting with abnormal liver function a high index of suspicion of the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is required.\n\n Low alkaline phosphatase level or an alkaline phosphatase (AP) to total bilirubin (TB) ratio54 may help to make a diagnosis of Wilson's disease in patients presenting with acute liver failure. In pregnancy the levels of alkaline phosphatase are elevated secondary to the placental isoform, it therefore may not aid in the diagnosis. 4 Serum ceruloplasmin levels are usually decreased by nearly 50% of the normal values in Wilson's disease, whereas they may be falsely negative (high) in pregnancy. Serum non-ceruloplasmin bound copper level ! 15 mg/dL is indicative of the disorder; however, these values depend on the estimation method and may be raised in other causes of acute hepatic inflammation. Increase in 24 h urinary copper excretion (!100 mg/24 h) is diagnostic in symptomatic patients, but these levels may also be increased in autoimmune hepatitis and hepatic necrosis. Invasive testing using liver biopsy to estimate hepatic parenchymal copper (!250 mg/g dry weight) and histology are not performed routinely in pregnant women due to risks involved and as they are not specific for the diagnosis. Although numerous mutations of the ATP7B are known, routine use of molecular genetic analysis is not recommended for diagnosis as most patients are compound heterozygotes (they may carry more than one mutation) and it is a laborious, long procedure to identify them. 2 Neuroimaging may detect structural abnormalities in the basal ganglia. 6 In our case, when she presented initially with haematemesis the diagnosis of Wilson's was not considered as it was uncommon in the region. Later when she presented with recurrence of her symptoms, evaluation showed KF ring and her subsequent evaluation led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.\n\n Most reports of pregnancy outcome are of women who conceived on treatment for Wilson's disease. A study by Sinha et al. observed an increase in incidence of miscarriage especially in untreated women, which may be due to the free intrauterine copper derived from excess non-ceruloplasmin bound copper. 7 Pregnancy does not seem to have an adverse effect on the clinical course of Wilson's disease, but preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have been reported in some cases. 8 These patients should be counselled against the use of oestrogen and copper-containing contraception; they should preferably be counselled to adopt barrier contraceptives or progesterone only methods.\n\n Concerns regarding treatment during pregnancy include the avoidance of teratogenic medication without affecting the health of mother. Care during pregnancy should utilise a multi-disciplinary team involving an obstetrician with special interest in medical disorders of pregnancy along with a gastroenterologist, neonatologist and obstetric anaesthetist to help optimise the outcome. Interruption of treatment during pregnancy has resulted in acute liver failure and even maternal death, suggesting the need to continue anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. 2, 9, 10 Teratogenicity may be due to copper deficiency during the critical time of fetal development, possibly due to pulsatile troughs during therapy with agents such as D-penicillamine or Trientine, which does not occur with zinc therapy.", "qa": [["21_52274300_1_1", "What are the initial manifestations of Wilson's disease and how do they present in patients?\n", "The initial manifestations of Wilson's disease can primarily present as hepatic dysfunction or neuropsychiatric symptoms.

His medical history included hypertension and SSS (Class \u0399), which was given the diagnose by medical physician a few years ago. He had been taking the vasodilator amlodipine for 6 years. The patient's left ventricular function was normal with an ejection fraction of 63%. His preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia (45 bpm), a prolonged PR interval of 0.23 seconds and a high voltage in V 1 (0.72 mV) and V 5 (2.87 mV) (Figure 1) . The oral and maxillofacial surgeon consulted the medical doctor in cardiovascular medicine about perioperative management. The medical doctor determined to need for a temporary pacing during general anesthesia because this patient have no subjective symptom at resting or on exercise and there were atrioventricular dissociation due to bradycardia all day, heart rate (HR) at 30 bpm range and cardiac arrest of last for 3 seconds or more all night in Holter ECG monitoring. Before surgery, the medical doctor inserted a temporary pacemaker (Reocor S) into the right ventricular apex via the femoral vein and set at VVI rate 30 ppm, pace 3 V and sense 2 mV. Before anesthetic induction, the patient's HR was 62 bpm and his BP was 158/92 mmHg. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (120 mg) and rocuronium (50 mg); after endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (1% -1.2% at gas analysis), remifentanil (0.1 -0.2 mcg/ml/h), and fentanyl (total dose of 300 \u00b5g). We usually administer sevoflurane or remifentanil at these concentrations and used remifentanil to be more stable for vital sign for oral and maxillofacial surgery. After intubation, the patient's HR and arterial blood pressure (ABP) gradually decreased; immediately before the operation, his HR was 36 -40 bpm and his BP was 76/38 mm Hg.

In vitro cytology results showed that combining drugs could improve the cytotoxic effect of SAL in HepG2 cells, but not in HepG2-TS. We surmised that the mechanism might be related to the basal autophagy flux, as autophagy plays a protective role in liver cancer. Therefore, we measured the basal autophagy flux of the two cell types, and demonstrated that it was significantly greater in HepG2 cells. When SAL was combined with CQ in HepG2 cells,the antitumor effect of SAL was improved because CQ could inhibit autophagy [35] . Furthermore, our group loaded SAL and DOX into liposomes separately, and in combination, to assess the subsequent antitumor activity in liver cancer.

The hydrophobic drug erlotinib and the hydrophilic drug DOX were encapsulated in the hydrophobic compartment and the hydrophilic interior of liposomes, respectively. This enabled them to achieve the desired time sequence of drug release in which erlotinib first inhibited EGFR activity in cancer cells and changed the intracellular apoptotic pathways, thus improving the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to the later release of DOX.

Although the defendant claimed that he did discuss the prospect of implanting a penile prosthesis with the plaintiff, the medical records were silent on that score.\n\n The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiff's failure to produce expert testimony on the issue of his damages precluded the entry of a verdict on those claims. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed and sent the case back to the trial court for a further trial on the issue of damages. The Supreme Court began its opinion by defining the doctrine of informed consent. According to the court, the informed consent doctrine requires physicians to provide patients with material information necessary to determine whether to proceed with the surgical or operative condition or to remain in the present condition. The information provided by a physician must give a patient 'a true understanding of the nature of the operation to be performed, the seriousness of it, the organs of the body involved, the disease or incapacity sought to be cured, and the possible results'. 61 Thus, a physician must 'advise the patient of those material facts, risks, complications and alternatives to surgery that a reasonable person in the patient's situation would consider significant in deciding whether to have the operation'. 62 A claim that a physician failed to obtain the patient's informed consent sounds in battery.\n\n According to the Supreme Court, the plaintiff unquestionably established a prima facie case of battery by introducing evidence that the defendant made physical contact with the plaintiff. Specifically, the plaintiff testified that, during consented-to revascularization surgery, the defendant implanted a penile prosthesis without the plaintiff's knowledge or consent. This contact left a palpable reminder in the form of the prosthesis, which the plaintiff discovered only after he awoke from surgery.\n\n In holding that the plaintiff was not required to produce expert testimony to support his damages claims, the supreme court stated the following:\n\n There is no question that [plaintiffs'] testimony concerned both physical and emotional damages and was often overlapping. Thus, John Montgomery spoke of diminished sensation in his penis during intercourse, the fact that he could not achieve an erection without pumping up the device and that he experienced pain and discomfort 'like sitting on a pin cushion' emanating from the device itself. Likewise, Marsha Montgomery testified that John was in a great deal of pain subsequent to the procedure. But there was also ample evidence of anguish and harm arising from the very fact of the presence of the unwanted device. John Montgomery testified that the prosthesis was cumbersome and embarrassing, and made him feel like a machine because he had to pump the prosthesis in order to achieve an erection. Both [plaintiffs] testified that the device had a negative emotional impact on their marital relations. The alleged emotional injuriesy are obvious and clearly connected to the prosthesis. It is within the range of comprehension of jurors whether emotional injuries might reasonably be attributable to the implantation of a penile prosthesis to which a patient did not consent and which he first became aware of only after awaking from anesthesia and being presented with a warranty card for the device. John Montgomery spoke directly to the emotional difference between his pre-existing condition and his condition after implantation of the prosthesis. The jury did not require an expert to explain to it the connection between an unwanted implantation of a penile prosthesis and the emotional injuries for which [plaintiffs] sought recovery. That John Montgomery might suffer these types of injuries is a direct and readily foreseeable consequence of the unwanted procedure. 63 In the end, the court ruled that the defendant could be liable for physical and emotional damages-in large part because there was little or no proof that the defendant ever discussed the implantation of a penile prosthesis with the plaintiff prior to the procedure.\n\n Informed consent must be an important and integral part of any discussion with a patient who is contemplating penile prosthesis surgery. Those physicians who perform penile prosthesis surgery (and any other physicians or surgeons for that matter) must treat the informed consent process Informed consent for penile prosthesis BC Nahrstadt seriously and dedicate sufficient time to discussing the matter with the patient. And those physicians who take the time to address and deal with the issues outlined in this paper will go a long way toward significantly reducing or eliminating their exposure to lack of informed consent claims.\n\n from the erectile cylinders in the penis.

Based on the Doppler sonographic findings of the breast, an MRI examination was planned to confirm the diagnosis of AVF and the aneurysm.\n\n Dynamic contrast enhanced breast MRI was performed on a 1.5-Tesla clinical MR system (General Electric Signa Excita, GE Health care system, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The patient was placed in the prone position, and a dedicated phasedarray bilateral four-channel breast coil (General Electric MRI devices, WI, USA) was used for imaging the breasts. The MRI scan protocol included axial T1-weighted fast spin echo (TR/TE, 560/7 msec), axial T1-weighted three-dimensional fast-spoiled gradient-echo fat-suppressed sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1 msec; flip angle 13\u00b0; bandwidth, 62,5), and axial and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin echo series (TR/ TE, 5000/85 msec). Finally, dynamic contrast-enhanced fatsuppressed T1-weighted gradient echo images (TE/TR 3.3/1 msec; flip angle 13, dynamic scan duration 60 sec) were acquired before and immediately after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-based contrast agent to study the contrast enhancement of the lesions.\n\n The MRI showed dilated venous structures in the upper quadrant of the left breast and dilated fusiform shaped arterial structure in the upper medial quadrant of the right breast. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) MRI illustrated an AVF in the left breast with communication occurring between the second medial mammary branch of the left IMA and left superficial mammarian venous structure with drainage toward the axillary vein ( figure 3 ). In the upper medial quadrant of the right breast, a fusiform aneurysm was seen that measured 16 mm x 10 mm in diameter, originating from the anterior perforating branch of the right IMA (figure 4).\n\n We attempted to refer the patient to another hospital for catheter angiography, because a catheter angiography unit is not yet established in our hospital. However, the patient did not agree to go to another hospital for angiography. The AVF was corrected surgically under general anesthesia, and the aneurysm was managed conservatively by thrombin injection.\n\n Vascular pathologies of the breast represent uncommon conditions, except for atherosclerotic disease of the breast. Vascular pathologies of the breast are classified into three categories: arterial, venous and mixed types AVFs, and true aneurysms of the breast, which are uncommon pathologies. The coexistence of a congenital AVF and true aneurysm of the breast is very rare.\n\n An AVF is an abnormal communication between an artery and a vein. An AVF may be congenital (usually affecting smaller vessels) or acquired as a result of trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm into an adjacent vein. Aneurysms are divided into two categories-true or pseudo-aneurysms. True aneurysms of the breast are thought to be due to prior trauma. Pseudo-aneurysms are most often associated with trauma and are recognized as a complication of diagnostic interventional techniques. In this case report, we describe a woman with a nontraumatic, presumably congenital AFV and true aneurysm of the breast originating from the internal thoracic artery. These vascular pathologies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mastodynia. In our case, the patient presented with nonspecific, intermittent, bilateral breast pain, especially in the upper quadrants.\n\n On physical breast examination, dilated venous structures were seen and systolic thrill was palpated in the left breast when the patient was lying down, especially in the prone position. Vlahos et al 3 presented a case of congenital AVF in a young woman; the chief complaint was a murmur when lying down, especially in the prone position, a palpated lump, and the presence of varicose-like veins in the breast, similar to our patient. Vascular disorders of the breast represent a broad spectrum of conditions, and differential diagnosis is difficult using only one imaging modality. 1 Multiple imaging modalities (eg, mammography, color Doppler ultrasound, and MRI) are used for the diagnosis of vascular breast pathologies. In our case, on color Doppler ultrasound, a fusiform shaped aneurysm in the right breast was demonstrated.

In this study, both the PDLSC and JBMSC sheets were closely arranged in a unidirectional or whirlpool-like pattern as shown by inverted microscopic observation and SEM, and this well-organized structure may optimize the function of these cells in developed periodontal tissue 32 . However, our observation of lateral sections via SEM and H&E staining showed that the PDLSC sheets contained multiple (3 to 7) layers of cells, secreted rich ECM and tended to form a tight network of collagen fibers that retained tight junctions. By contrast, JBMSC sheets contained fewer (2 to 4) layers of cells and secreted a limited amount of ECM. These differences may be attributed to the stronger proliferation ability of PDLSCs than JBMSCs and the tendency of PDLSCs to develop thicker collagen fibers 29 . PDLSCs and JBMSCs exhibited very different mRNA expression profiles after forming cell sheets, and the expression of nearly every gene we evaluated displayed an increasing trend after cell sheet formation. For example, after sheet formation, both PDLSC and JBMSC sheets exhibited higher expression levels of periodontal tissue-specific genes (Col1a1 and Col3a1); calcification-related genes (Runx2, Ibsp, Spp1 and Bglap); and adhesion-related genes (Fn1 and Lama1) compared to the corresponding cells. These results implied that cell sheets may be superior to cultured cells for the construction of periodontal tissue because cell sheets exhibit a more favorable transcriptional profile 29, 31 . In addition, we compared gene expression profiles between PDLSC and JBMSC sheets, and the results indicated that JBMSC sheets exhibited higher expression of calcification-related genes (Spp1 and Bglap), adhesion-related genes (Fn1 and Lama1), and periodontal tissue-specific genes (Col3a1 and Periostin) but lower expression of Cemp-1 than did PDLSC sheets. We found similar results for the protein expression level between these two types of stem cell sheets using western blot assays. These results indicated that the differential gene expression profiles of PDLSCs and JBMSCs continue from primary cells to cell sheets and that these differences influence the structure and function of newly formed tissues in vivo 29 . Based on immunohistochemical staining, both types of cell sheets displayed strong positive staining for FN1 and COL I; however, both PDLSC and JBMSC sheets demonstrated weakly positive staining for TNAP. COL I, the most abundant protein in ECM, serves as the structural support and binding partner for other ECM proteins, such as fibronectin. Therefore, COL I has been shown to promote the activation, migration, proliferation and differentiation of embedded stem cells 33 . In addition, the abundance of COL I in the examined samples indicated that both types of cell sheets support the formation of a natural, collagen-rich structure that can easily be fabricated into different shapes and sizes, thereby simplifying the process of combining seeded cells 31, 34 . TNAP is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, and the weakly positive staining for TNALP implied osteogenic differentiation potential in both JBMSC and PDLSC sheets.\n\n Third, we used PRF as a biodegradable scaffold to support, nourish and sustain cell sheets. As a 3-D fibrin network that releases multiple growth factors, PRF has been widely used in oral and plastic surgery 35, 36 . PRF has also been used as a scaffold adjuvant in tissue engineering because it can enhance cell proliferation and ECM metabolism in various connective tissues. Our ELISA results showed that high levels of growth factors were continuously released from \u03b1 granules of PRF for at least seven days 26 . PRF has several advantageous properties, such as high efficiency, one-step preparation and the provision of natural blood products in the absence of anticoagulants 36 . PRF has been widely reported to promote the proliferation ability of gingival fibroblasts, osteoblasts, JBMSCs and PDL cells but not epithelial cells due to the release of a set of growth factors that include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Therefore, PRF has been shown to either promote cell proliferation or increase ECM synthesis 37 .
