Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Intestinal iron absorption is thus blocked (Fig. 3) . Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Based on their pathological characteristics, the majority of meningiomas are benign, although some are malignant. Benign meningiomas are often treated with good results, but recurrence is very common among most malignant meningiomas. Moreover, some benign meningiomas can recur even after total resection and excision of the dura and affected bone (9) . Therefore, we presume that meningioma tumor stem cells may be responsible for these events. According to recent reports, CSC-like cells may be present in meningiomas (13, 17, 30) . Traditionally, Nestin, CD133 and Sox2 are regarded as CSC markers, but they could also be considered specific markers for BTSCs (28) . In this study, we investigated the expression of Nestin, CD133 and Sox2 in meningiomas.\n\n Nestin is a class six intermediate filament protein expressed in neural stem cells and BTSCs. Galani et al. investigated the expression of Nestin in 17 patients with meningiomas using qRT-PCR and found that Nestin was expressed at higher levels in atypical and anaplastic meningiomas than in benign meningiomas (9) . In the present study, all atypical and anaplastic meningiomas as well as the majority of benign meningiomas were positive for Nestin. However, Nestin was expressed at higher levels in non-benign meningiomas than in benign meningiomas, consistent with the results reported by Galani et al. However, Nestin expression is not a specific marker for BTSCs (12) ; thus, the identification of more markers is needed in the study.\n\n Prominin-1 (PROM-1), also known as CD133, is a protein with several isoforms with unknown physiological or pathological function that is expressed in both the cytoplasm and at the cell surface (22, 32) . CSCs in gliomas were first isolated by Singh et al.; they showed that only CD133-positive glioma cells have the characteristics of self-renewal, extensive proliferation, pluripotency and tumorigenesis initiation (26) .

Therefore, CD133 is regarded as a specific marker of BTSCs in malignant brain tumors (26) . In the present study, all WHO Grade II and III meningiomas were positive for CD133, whereas only 11 benign meningiomas were positive for CD133. Moreover, CD133 was expressed at much higher levels in the non-benign tumor group, and the rate of CD133 positivity was significantly lower than the rate of Nestin positivity, suggesting that CD133 is a better CSC marker for meningioma than Nestin. However, some CD133-cells also have BTSC properties. Beier et al. showed that some CD133-cells isolated from GBM were also tumorigenic in T-lymphocyte-deficient NMRI (nu/nu) mice (4). Joo et al. demonstrated that CD133+ and CD133-cells purified from GBM could initiate GBM-like tumors in NOD/SCID mice (15) . Therefore, CD133 may not be a specific marker for BTSCs.\n\n Sox2 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the maintenance of the self-renewal capability of neural stem cells, and its activity is associated with the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of CSCs in several tissues (1, 3, 8) . Ghods et al. demonstrated that 29.9% \u00b1 3.8% of 9L glioma stem cells are Sox2 positive, whereas 9L glioma cells are Sox2 negative (11) . Several groups have detected increased Sox2 levels in biopsies from patients with GBM, and the highest levels are associated with a poor outcome (25) . Other researchers found that Sox2 is the most enriched gene among the stemness signature in CD133+ GBM cells. Overexpression of Sox2 consistently enhances stem cell potency in GBM cell lines, whereas knockdown of Sox2 dramatically reduces CD133 expression and eliminates tumor initiation ability and drug resistance in CD133+ GBM cells (27). Therefore, Sox2 plays a crucial role in regulating tumorigenicity in CD133+ GBM cells and is regarded as a functional marker for BTSCs (29) . In the present study, none of the benign meningiomas were positive for Sox2, and only 4 non-benign meningiomas were positive for this marker.\n\n This study has several limitations. Although 35 cases of meningioma were included in our study, only 7 were WHO Grade II or III. Therefore, further investigations of larger numbers of meningioma cases are needed.\n\n In the present study, none of the benign Meningiomas were positive for Sox2, and only 4 non-benign meningiomas were positive for this marker.

He did not have a history of cryptorchidism, and his family history was negative for delayed puberty, cleft lip or palate, Hirschsprung disease, and KS. Based on anosmia from history, lack of puberty (Tanner stage G1P2) and bilaterally small testes (<3 ml) on examination, together with low circulating basal testosterone (<0.69 nmol/l), in association with inappropriately low gonadotropin levels (folliclestimulating hormone 0.54 mU/ml, luteinizing hormone 0.15 mU/ml), the diagnosis of KS was set, and puberty was induced with monthly Sustanon injections. His karyotype was 46, XY.\n\n At the age of 19 y, he participated in a study investigating KS in Estonia. He had bilaterally small testes (<3 ml) and anosmia as assessed with standardized twelve item odor stick series (Burghart Messtechnik, Wedel, Germany). Magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed olfactory bulb aplasia. When specifically asked for, he admitted early graying of hair, reduced sweating, but no gastrointestinal problems. Clinical examination confirmed the presence of gray hairs. He did not have birth marks, vitiligo, caf\u00e9 au lait spots, or any other pigmentation defects in the skin. He had broad nasal bridge, but no synophrys or hypoplasia alae nasi. His hearing loss, present from birth, was complete on the right side, and mild sensorineural hearing loss in high frequencies was noted in his left ear audiogram (Supplementary Figure S1 online) . He has mild myopia, and, in ophthalmologic examination, his fundi were normal. He had normal number of teeth. His muscle strength seemed normal, but he reported problems with balance, and was not able to stand on one foot. His joints in upper and lower extremities were hypermotile.\n\n Mutations in SOX10 are known to underlie WS4, PCWH, and WS2 neurocristopathies, which all share in common hearing loss and pigmentary anomalies (4-6). Our patient also reported early graying of hair, and one patient with KS in Pingault's series had premature whitening of hair (2) . Accordingly, SOX10 is important for the development of melanocytes, structures of inner ear, enteric ganglia neurons, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes (9, 10) . Studies with SOX10-null mutant mice show that underlying mechanism of this form of KS results from defects in embryonic development of olfactory ensheathing cells that are required for gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron migration (2, 11) .\n\n SOX10 is the second neural crest-related gene implicated in the etiology of KS. Indeed, mutations in CHD7-a key gene in neural crest development (12)-have been shown to underlie 3-5% of KS cases (7, 13, 14) , and CHD7 mutations may account as much as one third of KS cases with deafness (1). Our current data, especially when combined with that of Pingault et al., confirm a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations in SOX10 underlying deafness in patients with KS (2).\n\n In conclusion, targeting the molecular genetic diagnostics of KS can be challenging and therefore even subtle phenotypic cues may be of great value in this process. Hearing impairment is not a very common feature in KS, and its presence should lead the pediatrician to search additional phenotypic cues related to mutations in genes implicated in the development of neural crest, CHD7 and SOX10.\n\n Finally, it should be noted that there is a 50% chance to pass on the SOX10 gene defect to future children, who subsequently might present with a more severe SOX10-linked phenotype (4, 15) .

CLP is the second most common congenital birth defect in the U.S. trailing only Down syndrome (1) . There are roughly 7,000 infants born with orofacial clefts in the U.S. annually (1) . Beyond the physical effects on the patient, CLP also has significant psychological and socioeconomic effects on both patient and family, including disruption of psychosocial functioning and decreased quality of life (QOL) (2, 3) . It is associated with increased mortality from many causes, including suicide (4) as well as substantial healthcare costs (5) . Cleft lips can be unilateral or bilateral, and may involve the alveolus or palate. Affected individuals may present with other congenital anomalies and may be part of a genetic syndrome.\n\n Efforts are ongoing to uncover the epidemiology and etiology of this condition. The WHO-supported international collaborative research on craniofacial anomalies project establishes a global network to compile a comprehensive database and coordinate research strategies (6) . Optimal management of a child with cleft lip demands an organized multidisciplinary effort involving the fields of otolaryngology, plastic surgery, maxillofacial surgery, orthodontistry, speech therapy, pediatrics, nursing, genetics counseling, audiology, psychology, and social work (7) . The goals are to optimize feeding, facial growth, and speech and language development. One of the primary roles of the otolaryngologist is surgical repair to restore normal feeding, speech, and appearance. Successful repair of the cleft lip is simultaneously rewarding and challenging.\n\n The embryological development of the lip and palate is well documented. Normal lip development occurs between weeks 4 and 8 of gestation. By the end of week 4, the frontonasal prominence forms from migrating neural crest cells of the first pharyngeal arch. Nasal placodes, representing ectodermal thickening, develop at the caudal end of this structure and divide the paired medial and lateral nasal processes. The primary palate forms from the fusion of the paired medial nasal processes by week 6, giving rise to the premaxilla: central upper lip, maxillary alveolar arch and four incisor teeth, and hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen (8, 9) .\n\n The secondary palate develops after the primary palate during weeks 6-12. The medial projections of the maxillary processes form palatal shelves which rise above the tongue, fusing medially at the midline, anteriorly with the primary palate, and superiorly with the septum. The incisive foramen marks the anterior extent of the secondary palate. Formation of the primary and secondary palates completes the separation of nasal and oral cavities, permitting simultaneous respiration, and mastication (10) .\n\n Normal development occurs sequentially, thus cleft lip may or may not be associated with cleft palate. Similarly, isolated cleft palate may arise independently of cleft lip. Deformities of the lip, palate, and nose are a result of the disruption of normal development. The severity is dictated by the timing, severity, and amount of disruption (11) . A critical period is immediately before the formation of the primary palate and central lip, as the lateral nasal process undergoes a burst of mitotic growth. During this period, development is highly vulnerable to genetic and teratogenic effects (7) .\n\n CLP is traditionally classified by phenotype, which can have variable expression ranging from microform to complete clefting, and may involve the alveolar ridge and palate (Figure 1) . Phenotypes have been correlated with specific genetic linkage patterns, suggesting a possible correlation. CLP and CP are embryologically distinct processes from disruption at different stages of development and possess unique epidemiologic and genetic features (7, 10, 12) .\n\n www.frontiersin.org CLP refers to a clinical spectrum of cleft lip with or without associated cleft palate ( Table 1) . Palate involvement generally denotes a related but more severe form of this anomaly, although they may have epidemiologic differences (12) . Lip clefting may be complete (involving the full vertical height of the lip) or incomplete. Complete cleft lips are often associated with an alveolar cleft. The soft tissue bridge spanning the cutaneous lip or alveolus in an incomplete cleft lip is termed Simonart's band and consists primarily of skin with variable amounts of orbicularis oris muscle fibers (13) .\n\n Unilateral cleft lip (Figure 1) is associated with typical deformities caused by asymmetric forces on the premaxilla during facial growth.", "qa": [["45_6647847_0_1", "How does the embryological development of the lip and palate contribute to the occurrence of orofacial clefts?\n", "The embryological development of the lip and palate plays a crucial role in the occurrence of orofacial clefts.

Researchers need to consider whether the marginal benefits of developing and testing a bespoke questionnaire will outweigh the marginal costs. The design of new questionnaires requires consideration of whether to capture condition-related or total resource use. Whilst in principle only those resources relating to the condition in question are relevant, the definition of 'condition related' may not always be obvious. For example, a study on blood glucose control that included only diabetesrelated resource use might regard a hospital admission for a fractured leg as not relevant, when the accident may have been due to an episode of hypoglycaemia.\n\n There are also a number of important issues that apply regardless of whether a new or existing questionnaire is used. For example, while it may seem obvious that 'patient recall' data will be obtained from patients, this will not be possible with children or cognitively impaired adults and the literature on preference elicitation indicates that in many circumstances the question of who to ask is not straightforward [15, 16] . Similarly, the decision whether or not to capture participants' resource use prior to the start of a study has to be taken in context. In large trials, randomisation should ensure an even distribution between study arms of those who routinely are high resource users but, in smaller studies, it may be necessary to capture prestudy use of resources as a covariate [17] . The level of detail requested can also be problematic as patients' lack of knowledge of health service structures may lead them to misclassify resource usage. The cost implications of inputs by consultants versus junior doctors are significant but respondents are unlikely to know the grade of doctor who treated them or maybe even whether the health professional in question was a doctor or a nurse.\n\n The validation of cost questionnaires represents another area of considerable uncertainty. Validity assessment includes considering the extent to which an instrument measures what it purports to represent, and the degree to which it might be helpful in answering a particular question. New questionnaires require validation to ensure the appropriateness of the response categories, the clarity of the instructions, and the layout, format and length of the questionnaire. However, the absence of a gold standard can make this problematic.\n\n Only about 30 % of studies funded by the UK Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme described an RUM validation process [18] , which compares poorly with validation of patient-reported quality of life measures. However, these outcome measures are based on patient opinion rather than provable information, may apply to many cases, and represent a snapshot of health at a particular time; in contrast, RUMs are based on verifiable events, are completely specific to the context of the trial being undertaken, and cover a time period spanning the complete trial. Owing to the cognitive processes involved in responding to questionnaires and the nature of the data being collected, there may be some intrinsic conceptual challenges associated with validating RUMs. Based on the cognitive response model in which comprehension of the question is followed by retrieval of the relevant data before a judgment can be made and a final response given [19, 20] , much internal debate concerning a patient-reported quality of life measure takes place at the judgment stage, whilst for a resource-use question the internal debate may well arise at the retrieval stage. Given the different cognitive processes involved, it may not be reasonable to consider validity for patient-reported quality of life measures and costs in the same way.\n\n Validity measurement can take several forms [21] , although the empirical literature for RUMs has tended to focus on content and criterion validity. Some examples of content validity are expressed in terms of comparison with content in previously used questionnaires; however, these may not be adequate as evidence of validity-the argument that an instrument is validated because of a comparison to another (unvalidated) instrument is not necessarily logical. Criterion validity considers whether a measure performs well in relation to an identified gold standard; however, although a gold standard for costs may be provided by routine databases, the hypothesis that these systems are accurate and complete is questionable.\n\n Construct validity, commonly studied in outcomes measurement, focuses on expected relationships: an instrument is said to have construct validity if relationships with other measurements are as expected given the construct being assessed. However, for resource-use data the absolute quantities are likely to be just as important as any expected correlations and may be much more difficult to assess.\n\n Some early content validation could potentially be carried out by patient representatives on trial steering committees, patient groups and via qualitative interviews. Ideally, questionnaires should also be piloted to pinpoint where poor response exists and allow reduction in the length if resources are not consumed (provided the pilot is truly representative of the study population).", "qa": [["28_32853200_2_1", "What are the considerations researchers should take into account when deciding whether to develop a new questionnaire or use an existing one for capturing key information in a study?\n", "Researchers should weigh the marginal benefits and costs of developing and testing a bespoke questionnaire against the advantages of using existing questionnaires, such as cost-effectiveness and consistency across studies.

Less is known about the effect of flavonols in diabetic resistance arteries, where EDH is an important contributor to endotheliumdependent vasodilator function. 113 Actions of DiOHF were investigated in mesenteric arteries from type I and type II diabetic rats. The acute presence of DiOHF (10 mM) ex vivo reduced superoxide levels and improved endotheliumdependent relaxation in the mesenteric arteries of STZtreated and obese Zucker rats. 125 Short-term DiOHF (1 mg/ kg) treatment for 7 days also reduced vascular superoxide levels. This was associated with a reduction in NAPDH oxidase (Nox2) protein levels in the diabetic mesenteric arteries. Furthermore, DiOHF treatment improved ACh-mediated relaxation and attenuated enhanced contractile responses to endothelin-1 in the diabetic mesenteric arteries. 97 Overall improvement of endothelial function in DiOHF-treated diabetic rats is mediated by reversal of eNOS uncoupling, leading to enhanced NOS activity and improved NO-mediated relaxation. 97 DiOHF treatment had no significant effect on EDH responses in diabetic mesenteric arteries. 97 A further benefit of flavonols might be as antithrombotic agents. Previous studies demonstrated flavonols inhibited platelet aggregation and reduced thrombus formation. 126, 127 A recent study investigated the in vivo effects of quercetin and DiOHF in STZ-induced type I diabetic mice. 98 In response to protease-activated receptor-4 platelet stimulation, treatment with quercetin (6 mg/kg) or DiOHF (6 mg/kg) for 7 days reduced diabetes-induced platelet aggregation. 98 Treatment with quercetin or DiOHF also inhibited dense, but not alpha, granule exocytosis in diabetic and control mice. In addition, flavonol-treated mice displayed improved carotid artery blood flow compared with vehicle-treated diabetic mice. 98 In summary, the vasoprotective effects of flavonols in diabetes seem to be largely related to their antioxidant properties because in most cases flavonol treatment reduces oxidative stress (Table 2 ). This is likely achieved either by direct scavenging or by inhibition of ROS production as discussed earlier. The consequence of reduced oxidative stress is to increase NO bioavailability, thereby promoting vasorelaxation, anti-platelet aggregation, and reduced inflammation in the diabetic vasculature.\n\n Flavonols have a broad range of biological actions, including vasorelaxant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, which are linked to inhibition of a range of kinases. These actions may account for the strong positive correlation between a high dietary intake of flavonols and reduced risk of Flavonols have the advantage that as small, lipidsoluble molecules they can readily enter cells and exert their biological actions. Equally, this property makes it challenging for flavonols to be translated into clinical studies because their low aqueous solubility makes formulation for human use difficult. Furthermore, because of multiple biological actions, it is hard to achieve specificity and there is potential for unwanted side effects. For example, to achieve pharmacologically active concentrations (micromolar) of flavonols to exert their antioxidant activity in vivo, the possibility of hypotension arises given the vasorelaxant effect that may also occur at this concentration. Fortunately, water-soluble flavonol analogs retaining the biological activities of natural compounds have been synthesized. 24, 36, 39, 67 Furthermore, a watersoluble flavonol with anti-oxidant but not vasorelaxant activity has been synthesized, thus limiting potential side effects attributed to natural flavonols.

The specificity is far lower (49%) and this is the major drawback of the methodic in use, because the test doesn't discriminate between colorectal and other cells such us mesothelium cells. However, cytology and immunochemistry could be helpful in differentiating colonic cells from others. The bioinformatics data highlighted the efficacy of MMP7 to specifically subselect tumours with higher aggressiveness, suggesting a potential role of negative prognostic marker. In addition strikingly MMP-7 appeared correlated to tgfb-1. The correlation might probably potentiate the metastatic propensity of the cells, thus affecting progression of the disease and survival expectation. However, additional studies will be required to assess the cause/effect relationship between these two factors.\n\n In conclusion, positivity of MMP-7 in peritoneal cavity samples could be a novel biomarker for predicting disease recurrence in patients with CRC.\n\n \n\n Between November 2009 and November 2011, all the patients undergoing elective resection for cancer of the colon or intra-peritoneal rectum were enrolled in this prospective longitudinal study. Exclusion criteria were preoperative chemo-o radiotherapy and cancer of the low rectum.\n\n Peritoneal washing is done just after the laparotomy or laparoscopy, before colonic mobilization. One-hundred twenty ml of saline solution at 20\u00b0 C is instilled at the site of the tumor and 60 ml of this fluid is then aspirated and collected in sterile containers and sent for RNA extraction. Samples are centrifuged at 670 G for 10 minutes. RNA is extracted from the cell precipitate using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplified by Real-time PCR using the following conditions: denaturation, 1 minute at 95\u00b0C; hybridization, 30 seconds at 50\u00b0C; and finally elongation of the filament at 75\u00b0C for 30 seconds. During PCR, temperature variations are used to control the activity of the polymerase and the binding of the primers. The sequence of the primers for the MMP-7 is FWD: 5\u2032-ATGAACGCTGGACGGATGGT-3; REV: 5\u2032-TGGAGTGGAGGAACAGTGCT-3\u2032. The sequence of the primers for \u03b2-actin, used as an internal control, is: FWD: 5\u2032-AAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG ACC-3; REV: 5\u2032-AGCCAGTCCAGACGC AGGAT-3.\n\n The entire method is performed using the 'IQ SYBR Green Supermix' (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate by Real-time PCR. A sample was considered positive for the gene analyzed when adequate amplification curve was detected in the dual evaluation conducted on the same sample. Samples were considered negative when no amplified or only one amplified was detected. This method, based on duplicate analysis, allows reducing to a negligible value the probability that the amplified does not correspond in fact to the gene under study.\n\n After surgical resection, all patients are undergoing regular follow-up for assessing recurrence. Postoperative surveillance includes onco-markers, CT scan and colonoscopy.\n\n Gene expression datasets were analysed by using oncomine online tool (onocomine.org). Analysis of KaplanMaier estimation curve has been performed as previously described [174, 175] . Briefly, samples were divided in two cohorts so that to maximize positive correlation between expression profiles of MMP7 and TGFb1. The separation of patients into \"cohort 1\" and \"cohort 2\" along with survival information is next used to find any statistical differences in survival outcome. The R statistical package is used to perform survival analyses 1 and to draw KMplots.\n\n This study was supported by the European Society degenerative Disease (ESDD, www.esdd.it) (GS).", "qa": [["43_16701160_3_1", "What is the role of MMP-7 in colorectal cancer and how does it relate to disease prognosis?", "MMP-7 is a gene that plays a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis.

We present the case of a 43-year-old female with an ATRT found at the C1-3 level of the cervical spine. It was intradural/extramedullary in location and was completely excised after performing multilevel laminectomies. The patient continued to do well for 6 months following surgery and radiation therapy. Here, we review the three other adult spinal cases of ATRT reported in the literature, and discussed their average survival of only 20 months.\n\n \n\n A 43-year-old female with a significant history of chronic neck pain, migraine, and coronary artery disease presented acutely with marked exacerbation of chronic neck pain and headache. When initially seen, she was neurologically intact. While awaiting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain and cervical spine, she was found unresponsive and pulseless and required full cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The cervical MRI documented a C1-3 intradural, extramedullary, ventrolateral mass nearly filling the spinal canal resulting in severe compression of the upper cervical cord. Marked cord edema, seen on the T2 image, was present from C5 through the medulla [ Figure 1 ]. Following resuscitation, the patient was awake and alert, but was found to be quadriplegic, exhibiting no movement of sensation in all four extremities. She was immediately placed on intravenous steroids and taken to the operating room for a C1-3 decompressive laminectomy and gross total resection of the tumor [ Figure 2 ]. The pathological diagnosis proved to be consistent with an ATRT [ .\n\n Immediately postoperatively, the patient remained quadriplegic. However, on the postoperative day 12, she began moving the digits of the right hand and toes on the right side. She continued to exhibit poor respiratory effort and remained intubated for 14 days, subsequently requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy. After 36 days of inpatient care, the patient was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Upon discharge, she began a course of 28 fractions of radiation therapy for a total dose of 5040 cGy; she finished the radiation therapy 7 weeks later. Because of low performance status, she was no deemed a suitable candidate for chemotherapy.\n\n Twelve weeks postoperatively, she had regained antigravity strength in both the upper extremities and was able to feed herself. She also demonstrated gross movement in both the lower extremities in all muscle groups, however, this was still deemed nonfunctional strength. The subsequent cervical MRI at four months postopertive revealed no recurrent disease. At 6 months, the patient remained in a nursing home with a stable neurological exam. \n\n \n\n ATRT are highly aggressive lesions of the central nervous system (WHO grade IV), most frequently found intracranially in infants and young children. [8, 5] ATRT was first documented in an adult who presented with a brain tumor in 1992; since then, it has rarely been reported intracranially or within the spinal canal.

[4] Imaging of ATRT Imaging characteristics have been shown to be highly inconsistent including variable enhancement and cystic patterns. [7] They are found in the intradural space and do not typically invade extradurally nor exhibit bony invasion.\n\n To our knowledge, there are only three cases of primary ATRT that involve the adult spine. [1, 6, 8] Bruch et al. was the first to report ATRT in a 21-year-old female; however, this was only a minimal description of the specific pathological specimen. [1] Secondarily, a 43-year-old female with confirmed ATRT involving both the cervical and lumbar canal was described; this report afforded a detailed description of the molecular, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic characteristics.

The lethal dose for 50% of the irradiated animals after single-dose whole-body irradiation was lower for SCID mice than for C3H mice, as was the radiation dose that was needed to achieve 50% local control and tumour growth delay, Review thus confi rming that abnormal radiation sensitivity was observed in SCID mice. 44 A possible mechanism correlated with increased sensitivity of SCID tumour cell lines is the inability of the tumour cells to overcome their genetic defi ciency in DNA double-strand break repair in SCID fi broblasts. 45 More than 300 cases involving patients with connective tissue diseases have been published reporting toxicity after radiotherapy and several early and late radiotherapyrelated complications, including some deaths, have also been reported. 2,5,7,10, 46 The fi rst two severe events in patients with connective tissue diseases given radiotherapy were noted in the late 1960s. 47, 48 In one case, a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who had lymphoma died of heart failure 1 year after radiotherapy to the mediastinal and retroclavicular nodes (20 Rad [20 Gy] and 39 Rad [39 Gy], respectively, with \u2076\u2070Co), 47 whereas the second patient, who had facial lupus, developed radiotherapy-correlated osteomyelitis of the maxilla. 48 However, no data about radiotherapy dose or modality were provided.

At a median follow-up of 51\u00b78 months, all patients had subcutaneous fi brosis and xerostomia, two patients had radiation skin necrosis, and one patient had a VI and XII cranial nerve defi cit. 1 However, no information was provided about radiotherapy dose and techniques.\n\n Fleck and colleagues 2 published a study of nine patients with breast cancer (four women with a pre-existing connective tissue disease and fi ve who developed a connective tissue disease after radiotherapy). Eight received radiotherapy using \u2076\u2070Co with a prescription dose of 40-50 Gy and an electron boost on the tumour bed of 5-15 Gy. Three patients with a pre-existing connective tissue disease reported a severe toxicity profi le: the fi rst case involved moist desquamation and brachial plexopathy; the second case showed soft-tissue necrosis needing chest-wall resection, rib fractures, and pulmonary fi brosis; and the third patient had soft-tissue necrosis, bronchopleural-cutaneous fi stula, and osteonecrosis of the clavicle, sternum, and rib. None of the patients with a new diagnosis of connective tissue diseases after radiotherapy had severe complications. 2 According to McCormick, 49 to reduce the side-eff ects in patients with connective tissue disease and breast cancer, a more aggressive local surgery and systemic therapy, in particular for younger women (<40 years), was better than breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation. More recently, accelerated partial breast irradiation by either brachytherapy or intraoperative radiotherapy has been considered an alternative experimental option for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in women with a history of connective tissue diseases. Dragun and colleagues 9 published a report of nine patients with connective tissue diseases with breast cancer given accelerated partial breast irradiation via high-dose brachytherapy; toxicity and cosmetic profi les were reported as satisfactory. Indeed, the authors concluded that it might not be necessary to exclude patients with connective tissue diseases from clinical trials of accelerated partial breast irradiation.

Most existing statutes incorporate \"comfort care\" as an exclusion from the definition of life-sustaining treatment. Because many such procedures are life-sustaining, however, the Act avoids definitional confusion by treating them in a separate provision that reflects the Act's policy more clearly, and better reflects the fact that comfort care does not involve a fixed group \n\n Akron Law Review, Vol. 24 [1991], Iss. 3, Art. 8 http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol24/iss3/8\n\n of procedures applicable in all instances.\n\n Subsection (9) of Section 1 is the \"terminal condition\" definition. The difficulty of trying to express such a condition in precise, accurate, but not unduly restricting language is obvious. A definition must preserve the physicians' professional discretion in making such determinations. Consequently, the Act's definition of terminal condition incorporates not only selected language from various state acts, but also suggestions from medical literature in the field.\n\n The Act employs the term \"terminal condition\" rather than terminal illness, and it is important that these two different concepts be distinguished. Terminal illness, as generally understood, is both broader and narrower than terminal condition. Terminal illness connotes a disease process that will lead to death; \"terminal condition\" is not limited to disease. \"Terminal illness\" also connotes an inevitable process leading to death, but does not contain limitations as to the time period prior to death, or potential for nonreversibility. as does \"terminal condition.\"\n\n The terminal condition definition requires that the condition be \"incurable and irreversible.\" These adjectives were chosen over the similar phrase, \"no possibility of recovery,\" because of possible ambiguity in the term \"recovery\" (i.e., recovery to \"normal\" or to some other stage). A number of state statutes now use \"incurable\" and/or \"irreversible.\" and the terms appear to comport with the criteria applied by physicians in terminal care situations. The phrase \"incurable and irreversible\" is to be read conjunctively as long as the circumstances warrant. A condition which is reversible but incurable is not a terminal condition. Subsection (9) also requires that the condition result in the death of the patient with a \"relatively short time ... without the administration of life-sustaining treatment.\" This requirement differs to some degree from the language employed in most of the statutes. First. the decision that death will occur in a relatively short time is to be made without considering the possibilities of extending life with lifesustaining treatment. The alternative is that required by a number of states-that death be imminent whether or not life-sustaining procedures are applied. The President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical Research has noted that such a definition severely limits the group of terminally-ill patients able to qualify under these acts. It is precisely because life can be prolonged indefinitely by new medical technology that these acts have come into existence. Though the Act intends to err on the side -of prolonging life, it should not be made wholly ineffective as to the actual situation it purports to address. The provisions which require that death be imminent regardless of the application of life-sustaining procedures appear to have that effect. Therefore, such provisions have been excluded in the Act.\n\n The terminal condition definition of subsection 19) requires that death result \"in a relatively short time.\" Rejecting the \"imminency\" language employed in a number of statutes, this alternative was chosen because it provides needed flexibility and reflects the balancing character of the time frame judgment. Though the phrase. \"relatively short time,\" does not eliminate the need for judgment, it focuses the physician's medical judgment and avoids the narrowing implications of the word \"imminent.\"\n\n The \"relatively short time\" formulation is employed to avoid both the unduly constricting meaning of \"imminent\" and the artificiality of another alternative-fixed time periods, such as six months, one year. or the like. The circumstances and inevitable variations in disorder and diagnosis make unrealistic a fixed time period. Physicians may be hesitant to make predictions under a fixed time period standard unless the standard of physician judgment is so loose as to be unenforceable. Under the Act's standard, considerations such as the strength of the diagnosis, the type of disorder, and the like can be reflected in the judgment that death will result within a relatively short time.", "qa": [["8_39161916_12_1", "How does the Act's definition of \"terminal condition\" differ from the commonly understood concept of \"terminal illness\"?\n", "The Act distinguishes between \"terminal condition\" and \"terminal illness.\" While \"terminal illness\" refers to a disease process that will lead to death, \"terminal condition\" is not limited to disease and encompasses a broader range of conditions.

Although ICRT has been reported to decrease diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) before surgery, 6, 7 there have been few reports examining the effects of ICRT on postoperative pulmonary function.

To measure the regional lung function, the following methods have been reported: (1) calculation of the number of ''subsegments,'' 9 (2) computed tomography (CT) volumetry, 10 and (3) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) lung perfusion. 11 Of these, SPECT lung perfusion is reported to be the most accurate method for measuring regional lung function. 12 Using SPECT perfusion, the regional function can be calculated using the following formula: (the radioactivity of regional lung/the radioactivity of whole lung) 3 whole lung function measured using a pulmonary function test (PFT).\n\n In the present study, to clarify the effect of ICRT on postoperative changes of whole-lung and regional lung functions, we conducted PFT with spirometry and SPECT lung perfusion before as well as after lobectomy, and compared the data between patients treated with and without ICRT using propensity score matching.\n\n \n\n The study was a retrospective matched cohort study of consecutively acquired data.

The exclusion criteria for postoperative examinations were as follows: patients with tumor recurrence, pulmonary complications after surgery, and postoperatively another disease that could affect pulmonary function. The exclusion criteria for patients, who were examined pre-and postoperatively, were as follows: previous lung surgery, additional lung resection of another lobe during surgery, rib resection, phrenic nerve resection, and preoperative radiation therapy alone or chemotherapy alone.

Peroxynitrite, a reaction product of these radicals, is a powerful oxidant, and its toxic effects are implicated in vascular dysfunction associated with hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes (53) . Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant defense enzyme that counters superoxide anion, are produced by endothelial cells exposed to WSS that is uniform in magnitude and direction (52) . This realization poses another mechanism by which low values of oscillatory WSS could contribute to the initiation and development of atherosclerotic disease.\n\n Despite large changes in cardiac output-as much as a fivefold increase during maximum exercise-the timeaveraged WSS remains relatively constant in magnitude in large arteries (between 10 and 30 dyne/cm 2 ) (52,54 -56) . This control over WSS values imposed on the endothelium is afforded by the change of vessel diameter. The conformational changes of the endothelial membrane and membrane cytoskeletal proteins brought on by fluid forces leads to downstream cell activation (45) . The WSS acting on the luminal surface of the endothelium is also relayed throughout the cell by the cytoskeleton to sites that convert this mechanical signal into electrophysiologic, biochemical, and genetic responses (57). Davies et al (57) studied 15,000 differentially profiled endothelial genes that had been isolated from two regions of pig aorta (one region prone to atherosclerotic disease and disturbed flow, and the other resistant to plaque formation being exposed to laminar, unidirectional flow) and determined that less than 200 (1.5%) of these genes were differentially expressed. Such studies can provide the determination of atheroprotective and atheropermissive gene expression. One drawback to the genomics approach for elucidating endothelial response to regions of disturbed flow is the inability to obtain gene expression of a few cells, which leads to the spatial and temporal averaging of a larger region. The use of techniques such as atomic force microscopy and scanning confocal microscopy provides information about structural and biochemical responses of the endothelium on a subcellular level.\n\n Plaque composition and structural integrity are highly variable, being not only patient specific, but site specific as well. Glagov and colleagues (25) proposed that the initial formation of plaques occurs in faintly disrupted luminal surfaces, the irregularities of which are imposed by the shape of the subendothelial foam cells. These areas of focal flow disturbance are associated with foam cell penetration of the endothelium, fiber exposure, and platelet deposition (58) . Plaque modeling continues with the accumulation of thrombocytes and monocytes in the interrupted sites of the endothelium (25) . This process, a combination of destructive and defensive healing, is complex, and for further study the reader is referred to more complete literature reviews by Glagov and colleagues (25, 48) . In the absence of plaque disruptions, fissuring, hemorrhage, or thrombus deposition, the luminal aspect of mature lesions remains smooth, with a relatively circular cross-section so as to preserve laminar flow (48) . Fluid mechanics play a role not only in the production and organization of the plaque modeling, but also in the eventual advent of plaque complications, such as the rupture of the fibrous cap, which potentiates the onset of clinical symptoms.\n\n Desquamation of the endothelial cells has been identified at WSS levels exceeding 300 dyne/cm 2 (24) . Such a WSS value, however, is not physiologically relevant, because the time-averaged shear stress in large arteries is between 10 and 30 dyne/cm 2 . Nonetheless, there are other mechanisms of endothelial damage that merit due consideration, as it is well accepted that mechanical or biochemical injury to the endothelium is a crucial initiating event of atherosclerotic disease (45) .\n\n Turbulence is seldom realized in physiologic flows not pertaining to pathologic states, with the exception of flow in the ascending aorta. In the scenario of extreme stenosis, however, transition to local turbulence, characterized by the stochastic generation of three-dimensional vortices, may occur (45) . Endothelial cells that experience turbulent flow with a mean WSS of 1.2 dyne/cm 2 proliferate at a high rate, with no cell-to-cell contact (59) . The turbulent forces are sufficient to eliminate intracellular connections of the endothelium.", "qa": [["70_30094458_5_1", "How does the production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion by endothelial cells contribute to vascular dysfunction?\n", "The production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion by endothelial cells can lead to vascular dysfunction, particularly in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.

Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated 2DG's inhibitory effect on chemoresistant tumor cells and on cancer stem-like cells [36] [37] [38] .\n\n Metformin is a frontline therapy for type 2 diabetes. The safety and side effects of metformin is well documented since it has been prescribed to more than 120 million diabetic patients world-wide. Epidemiologic, retrospective, and laboratory studies strongly suggest that metformin has anti-tumor effects in a wide range of cancer [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Metformin's anti-tumor effect can be both direct and indirect. The drug directly targets the insulin like-growth factor (IGF) and insulin pathway, both of which are known to have tumor promoting effects, while indirectly, metformin has been reported to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I respiratory chain, inhibiting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), increasing lactate production, and rendering the tumor cells energetically inefficient [45, 46] .\n\n Our studies characterized some key metabolic features of EWS cells and examined the effects of inhibiting glycolysis and OXPHOS separately and simultaneously in EWS cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that these classes of compounds can be used to overcome therapeutic resistance and inhibit cancer stemlike cells in EWS, providing evidence that metabolic modulation has therapeutic potential for treatment of EWS.\n\n \n\n To characterize the bioenergetic profiles of the EWS cells, we did extracellular flux analysis on a panel of three established EWS cells using Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer ( Figure 1A ). We quantified their glycolytic activity by measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as glycolytic cells produce more protons [47] . Relative contributions of different biochemical pathways were then measured by adding specific inhibitors. ECAR following the addition of glucose defines glycolysis and ECAR following oligomycin represents maximum glycolytic capacity. ECAR prior to the addition of glucose and following treatment with 2-DG represents acidification associated with non-glycolytic activity. Compared to the two non-malignant (NM) cells, all three EWS cells showed high ECAR, and that the EWS cells were very close to their maximum glycolytic capacity, even at resting state. The ratio between the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ECAR showed the EWS cells varied in their energy profile in terms of mitotic respiration, but overall, preferred aerobic glycolysis compared to the NM cells, which exhibited a less energetic profile ( Figure 1B) . This was further confirmed by the lactate measurement ( Figure 1C ) from the culture media of three EWS cell lines, namely A673, MHH, TC71 and two nonmalignant (NM) cell lines -hFOBS, and IMR-90. The lactate levels measured in the media of the EWS cell lines were higher than the NM cells from six hours onwards. At 24 hours, lactate produced by EWS cells were significantly higher (p= 0.0012), showing high glycolytic activity by these cancer cells compared to the NM cells.\n\n We postulated that a combination of metformin and 2DG would significantly affect tumor cell proliferation and viability, as summarized in the schematic ( Figure  2A ). The two main glucose metabolism pathways involve a) oxidative phosphorylation in TCA cycle involving 4 cells were collected to determine extracellular lactate level, lactate measurements showed significant increase at 72 hours compared to the NM cells. *p <0.05 was regarded as significant and calculated by comparing the means of the two groups with unpaired t test. Data represents the mean of three wells \u00b1 standard deviation. mitochondrial respiration complex I-IV and b) glycolysis. Metformin acts as the inhibitor of the former, while 2DG of the latter. Glucose transport across the cell membrane is mediated by the glucose transporters (GLUT) while organic cation transporters (OCT) actively transports metformin (MET) inside the cell. Metformin-induced mitochondrial respiration inhibition in EWS cells would increase lactate production, as cells would try to \"rescue\" energy production through aerobic glycolysis. On the other hand, treatment with 2DG should inhibit aerobic glycolysis, as can be observed by the decrease in lactate production and consequently inhibit tumor cell viability.", "qa": [["4_10917525_1_1", "How does metformin affect tumor cells and what are its mechanisms of action?\n", "Metformin has been shown to have anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer.

The centrality of highly variable human behavior provides enormous challenges to managing populations of those with chronic diseases. It requires reorienting resources within the health care system to address ongoing, effortful, and complex behaviors of patients amid strong competing priorities.\n\n Major reviews 2 document that peer support provided by ''community health workers,'' ''lay health advisors,'' ''promotores,'' ''patient navigators,'' and individuals with a number of other titles can make important contributions to health care and prevention, including chronic care. However, many studies focus on selected, sometimes high-risk samples or samples of special interest. As much as these may illuminate effectiveness and key features of peer support, they provide little guidance as to how to take peer support to scale to serve the populations who may benefit from it. For example, to serve the estimated 387 million with diabetes worldwide would require 715,000 full-time peer supporters, each with caseloads of 500, or 39 million volunteers, each assisting 10 patients.\n\n Although sometimes seen as antithetical to the person-toperson contact of peer support, the spread of the Internet, social media, and smartphones, and the arrival of each technological advance offer new ways to deliver health care services, including those to support prevention and ongoing disease management. In the past 2 decades, many studies have affirmed the effectiveness of eHealth for a variety of health outcomes. 3 Although eHealth offers a platform for reaching populations, we cannot rely on technology alone. In their current state, consumer eHealth technologies sometimes have difficulty engaging people and cannot comprehensively address people's complex needs. 4 In contrast to the eHealth model, peer support delivers highly personalized and engaging support to people at all levels of need. 5 Importantly, this includes the ability of peer support to (1) reach and engage those who are often ''hardly reached'' by clinical and preventive services, and (2) reduce emotional and psychosocial distress among those with chronic conditions and the avoidable acute and hospital care that so often accompany it. 5 Studies have documented the effectiveness, feasibility, and wide acceptability of peer support for chronic disease management and prevention in diverse settings and populations. 2, 5 With the engagement of peer support and the reach of eHealth (and the effectiveness and feasibility of both approaches), we therefore ask: Can we integrate the high tech of eHealth with the soft touch of peer support to manage the health of populations? If so, what might such an integration look like?\n\n Peers for Progress, with support from the Gillings Innovation Lab program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is developing and testing a model that integrates eHealth with lay health coaching for people living with type 2 diabetes. The base of the program will be a one-toone relationship of the patient with a health coach. WellDoc's BlueStar diabetes ''app,'' 6 the first Food and Drug Administration-cleared mobile prescription therapy (accessible on both smartphones and computers) will deliver diabetes education, monitoring, and messaging and so reduce the demands on live coaches to deliver such services. The pilot will be implemented in collaboration with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield and Vanguard Medical Group, a primary care group practice in north and central New Jersey. Three out of 5 of the Vanguard sites are recognized as patient-centered medical homes with care coordination processes to manage high-risk patients. The pilot test will aim to engage 200 patients referred from Vanguard's clinics.\n\n A key component of our program will be titrating different levels of live peer support according to the needs and preferences of patients. Adults with diabetes with good selfmanagement and motivation may have their needs adequately addressed by the BlueStar app and only occasional health coaching. More intensive coaching may be reserved for patients with greater needs, such as those with poor selfmanagement, complex multimorbidities, or psychosocial concerns. BlueStar's features can handle the more routine tasks of self-management, allowing health coaches to provide more individualized services. Cutting across this titration of services, patients will be free to access BlueStar, the health coach, and/or both, according to their preferences and sense of need.\n\n In order to tailor intervention components to the needs of all stakeholders involved, we conducted qualitative research with patients, medical providers, and care coordinators at Vanguard. With the help of the director of care coordination, purposive sampling identified and recruited 4 care coordinators (all registered nurses), 1 medical provider (physician assistant), and 4 patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 52 to 80 years; living with diabetes for a range of 7 to 40 years).", "qa": [["67_27745775_0_1", "What are some challenges in managing populations with chronic diseases?\n", "Managing populations with chronic diseases presents challenges due to the highly variable human behavior and competing priorities of patients.
