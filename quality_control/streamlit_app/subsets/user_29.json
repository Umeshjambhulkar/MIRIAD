Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] .

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Indeed, Follmer and Colatsky24 recently demonstrated that flecainide also blocks the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in cat ventricular myocytes. A possible explanation for the tachycardia dependence of flecainide's effect of prolonging APD may be that the drug preferentially binds to the open (activated) state of the potassium channel. 21 Our observation of a greater prolongation of APD in ventricular epicardium compared with endocardium is concordant with the findings of Le Grand et a120 showing that flecainide-induced APD prolongation is greater in human atrial fibers displaying a spike-and-dome action potential configuration. In that study, as in ours, elimination of the notch (spike and dome) using the transient outward current blocker 4-AP greatly reduced the flecainide-induced prolongation of APD.\n\n In a previous study, we described the ability of flecainide and other sodium channel blockers to induce postrepolarization refractoriness and to markedly depress excitability in a use-dependent manner in epicardium but not endocardium.2 This effect of the sodium channel blockers produced an inversion of the normal effective refractory period-rate relation in epicardium; refractoriness was observed to increase dramatically at faster stimulation rates. This effect of flecainide in epicardium and its effect of flattening the APD-rate relation in endocardium (Figures 2 and 3 ) approach the behavior expected from an \"ideal\" antiarrhythmic drug. 25 Sodium channel inhibition appears to contribute to both the antiarrhythmic as well as proarrhythmic actions of flecainide, since drug-induced block of the sodium current is the primary factor responsible for loss of the action potential dome and the development of electrical heterogeneity in epicardium. A proarrhythmic effect of sodium channel blockade has been demonstrated in other in vitro (guinea pig) and mathematical models.13 '26 Reduction in sodium channel availability was shown to increase the vulnerable period during which a premature stimulus could elicit repetitive activity.\n\n Flecainide-induced abolition of the action potential dome in canine ventricular epicardium but not endocardium leads to the development of a prominent dispersion of repolarization in tissues spanning the ventricular wall (Figure 3 ). Dispersion of repolarization also occurs in epicardium because of the loss of the dome at some sites but not others ( Figure 5 ). This heterogeneity contributes importantly to the arrhythmogenicity of the drug (Figures 6-11) .\n\n Extrasystolic activity is much more easily induced with flecainide than with other sodium blockers in isolated epicardium.2 This may be due to the fact that profound sodium channel block and thus marked dispersion of repolarization can occur at relatively slow stimulation rates. This is possible because flecainide's strong use-dependent block of the sodium current allows for the development of potent sodium channel block at rates that permit ample time for recovery of the transient outward current. The combination of potent INa block and high availability of I,. strongly favors the loss of the dome and the development of electrical heterogeneity and arrhythmic activity. The degree to which flecainide's inhibition of Ica and IK contributes to these phenomena remains to be determined. Block of IK could serve to further intensify the differences in repolarization times by prolonging APD in endocardium at a time when the epicardial action potential is markedly abbreviated because of loss of the dome. To explain the differential effects of flecainide on epicardium and endocardium, we considered the hypothesis that differences in the responsiveness of the two tissues to the drug were due largely to the presence of an I,.-mediated spike and dome (notch) in epicardium but not endocardium.

Variations in the intensity or availability of I,, may also underlie differences in the responsiveness of different epicardial sites to flecainide.

Flecainide's strong use-dependent block of the sodium current allows for potent sodium channel block at rates that permit ample time for recovery of the transient outward current, leading to marked dispersion of repolarization and arrhythmic activity.

Errors in measurement can occur at each of these interaction points of the technique, but by far the most fallible component is the observer.\n\n K Observer error. Observer error, which can greatly affect accuracy of measurement falls into three categories (Table 3) .\n\n K Mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers. The mercury sphygmomanometer is a reliable device, but all too often its continuing efficiency has been taken for granted, whereas the aneroid manometer is not generally as accurate. An inflation/deflation system, an occluding bladder encased in a cuff, and auscultation using a stethoscope are features common to these devices, any of which may introduce error. Users should be aware of the hazards of mercury, which may soon be banned from use in clinical medicine. Aneroid sphygmomanometers register pressure through a bellows and lever system, which may become inaccurate with everyday use, usually leading to falsely low readings with the consequent underestimation of blood pressure. A stethoscope should be of a high quality with clean, well-fitting earpieces.\n\n K Automated alternative devices to the mercury sphygmomanometer. Given the increasing concern for mercury toxicity, mercury sphygmomanometers are likely to be banned from clinical practice in the near future. Alternative solutions need therefore to be explored, among which a role has been suggested for automated blood pressure measuring devices. An accurate automated sphygmomanometer capable of providing print-outs of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, together with heart rate and the time and date of measurement should eliminate errors of interpretation and abolish observer bias and terminal digit preference, and should be used when possible. Moreover, the need for elaborate training as described above would no longer be necessary, although a period of instruction and assessment of proficiency in using the automated device will always be necessary.\n\n K The observer should ensure that the manometer is no more than 3 feet away so that the scale can be read easily, that the mercury column is vertical, that the bladder dimensions are accurate and if the bladder does not completely encircle the arm its centre must be over the brachial artery.\n\n K The stethoscope should be placed gently over the brachial artery at the point of maximal pulsation; the cuff should then be inflated rapidly to about 30 mmHg above the palpated systolic pressure and deflated at a rate of 2-3 mmHg per pulse beat (or per second) during which the auscultatory phenomena described in Table 4 will be heard.\n\n K Disappearance of sounds, or the first mmHg level at which the sounds are no longer audible (phase V) should be taken as diastolic pressure except when sounds persist down to zero, when muffling of sounds (phase IV) should be recorded for diastolic pressure.\n\n K The points listed in Table 5 should be recorded. Rounding to digit preference-often zero Observer prejudice or bias Adjustment of pressure to suit observer Table 4 Auscultatory sounds\n\n Phase I The first appearance of faint, repetitive, clear tapping sounds which gradually increase in intensity for at least two consecutive beats is the systolic blood pressure. Phase II A brief period may follow during which the sounds soften and acquire a swishing quality.\n\n In some patients sounds may disappear altogether for a short time. Phase III The return of sharper sounds, which become crisper to regain, or even exceed the intensity of phase I sounds. The clinical significance, if any, to phases II and III has not been established.\n\n The distinct abrupt muffling of sounds, which become soft and blowing in quality. Phase V\n\n The point at which all sounds finally disappear completely is the diastolic pressure.

Nevertheless, practitioners perceive barriers to the implementation of EBP, such as the nature of research evidence (i.e. inconsistencies in the outcomes of research studies, absence of evidence, reduced clinical applicability) (McCurtin & Roddam, 2012) , as well as the lack of time and the lack of skills (Stephens & Upton, 2012) . One way to improve the engagement of speech and language therapists with EBP is to give more consideration to it in their initial education.\n\n The integration of EBP into SLT curricula has been increasingly discussed in recent years. Papers have outlined how to implement EBP into a curriculum (Klee, Stringer & Howard, 2009) or investigated the perceptions of either academic and clinical education staff (Togher et al., 2011) or undergraduate students (Cobus-Kuo & Waller, 2016) about EBP education. Instructional methods have also been described, such as problem-based learning (Raghavendra, 2009) , case-based learning (McCabe, Purcell, Baker, Madill & Trembath, 2009) or the use of the systematic review process as a learning tool (Proly & Murza, 2009 ). Other papers have reported the assessment of a singlesession intervention using a pre-and post-test design (Grillo, Koenig, Gunter & Kim, 2015) , or have investigated the link between EBP competencies and EBP self-efficacy and task value (Spek, Wieringa-de Waard, Lucas & van Dijk, 2013) . The most effective methods for teaching each step of the EBP process should be fostered (Dawes et al., 2005) . A recent systematic review in the health care field highlights that teaching and learning strategies should focus on implementing multifaceted, clinically integrated approaches with assessment (Young, Rohwer, Volmink & Clarke, 2014) . Additionally, learning from other fields may be interesting, given the interdisciplinary nature of SLT (Schlosser & Sigafoos, 2009 ). However, variability in EBP education and heterogeneity in reporting the interventions are two methodological issues that have been raised in this area (Phillips et al., 2014) . Due to the limited evidence regarding teaching strategies and learning outcomes, conducting studies on this topic remains essential in order to identify best practices (Dizon, Grimmer-Somers & Kumar, 2012; Young et al., 2014) .\n\n The study aimed to evaluate whether an EBP educational module for undergraduate SLT students can improve their EBP competencies. The main objective of this study was to assess the change in knowledge and skills, relating to the first three steps of EBP (i.e. asking a question, searching for evidence and appraising the evidence), when SLT students participated in an EBP educational module. Their performances were compared to those of control students not doing the module. The second objective was to obtain the SLT students' perceptions towards the EBP educational module, as a way of collecting feedback that can help to refine and improve the module.\n\n Several pieces were implemented to achieve both objectives. The methodological design is presented in Figure 1 .\n\n The Faculty of Psychology, Speech Therapy, and Education of the University of Li ege -a public university in the French Community of Belgiumoffers a 5 year SLT curriculum. During the threefirst years, students undertake mainly theoretical courses (such as in biomedical sciences, psychology, speech therapy) and courses in research methodology (such as statistics, information literacy [IL] ). Clinical training is emphasised during the last 2 years. In this context, an educational module focusing on EBP was planned for fourth year SLT students.\n\n For this study, a pre-and post-test study design was used to assess the change in students' EBP knowledge and skills. In addition, a questionnaire examined the perceptions of the trained group towards the educational module. The SLT faculty of the EBP module approached the students and explained the aim of the study. She invited them to participate and announced the dates to take the pretest and the post-test. Before beginning the pre-test, students were again informed about the study and their participation.\n\n The Faculty of Psychology, Speech Therapy, and Education of the University of Li ege also offers a 5 year curriculum in psychology.

As certain HIV and right-to-health groups started to raise the issue of pharmaceutical pricing, others quickly splintered off. Additionally, the Association of High-Cost Patients-which had merged with another patients' group to form Pacientes Colombia in the early 2000s-survived for only two years before splitting back in two for the same reason. 65 The disunity was also driven by the opinion held by many HIV activists that HIV was actually not a \"high-cost\" condition and that in a properly regulated system, life-saving treatment for HIV would not be exorbitantly expensive. 66 The T-760 decision and resulting reform By 2008, the number of annual health care tutelas had swelled to over 100,000, all but forcing the Con- But in framing the right to health in the same way that the HIV movement had done for years, the court not only addressed most of the movement's longstanding goals but also popularized its conceptualization of health as a human right.\n\n First, T-760 and the policies that followed made the POS more generous, more equitable between the contributory and subsidized plans, and less arbitrary in determining exclusions. In keeping with the court's orders, the government equalized the POS-C and POS-S in 2012. 70 By 2017, the POS will pivot from being a list of covered treatments that excludes anything not enumerated to a list of excluded treatments with coverage otherwise presumed. 71 This reversal of defaults should mean a reduced need for advocacy around the inclusion of new HIV treatments. The court also ordered that measures be taken to prevent the arbitrary denial of covered services, including discriminatory denials against people living with HIV. 72 Although T-760 permitted the government to reduce nonessential benefits in merging the plans, those in the subsidized plan will ultimately have greatly enhanced coverage. 73 This includes many treatments that, while not directly related to HIV, are required to treat conditions that are complicated by HIV. The significance of this problem for HIV patients was noted by Aquiles Arrieta, an auxiliary magistrate with the court who worked on the decision. 74 Second, the decision represents a reduction of the need to use tutelas for HIV treatment. In many countries, the judicialization of health rights has been criticized as exacerbating inequities because the most marginalized groups have difficulty accessing courts. 75 Many of our interviewees felt that the evidence was mixed in terms of whether tutelas had improved health equity, noting that tutelas could be completed without the help of an attorney (unlike in many countries) but at a lower rate of success. 76 The patients' groups may have eased inequity by providing assistance to those who were unable to file tutelas on their own. 77 Nonetheless, some felt the system overwhelmingly benefited the privileged.\n\n Only a few interviewees felt strongly that local court access was reasonably equitable. 79 Even if this is true, those in the subsidized regime were still at a disadvantage because they had to fight more exclusions than their counterparts in the contributory scheme. 80 Additionally, it was hard to enforce tutelas ordering the provision of HIV medications in the POS-S pharmacies because these pharmacies often did not have such medications in stock.\n\n 81 Therefore, T-760 can be seen as addressing a fundamental limitation of the tutela system as a means of achieving the movement's goals.\n\n Third, the decision led to an unprecedented public debate on health care and to a reconceptualization of health as a human right. An unexpectedly large and diverse group of patients, providers, and the general public rallied in support of the Constitutional Court and in opposition to then president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who opposed the decision. 82 The public essentially embraced what the HIV movement had argued for years: that health was a fundamental right that the health care system of Law 100 had systematically violated. Many of our interviewees considered this symbolic shift to be the most important direct impact of the court's decision, especially since the long-term effects of health care reform remain to be seen. 83 Despite the fact that the decision addressed these three significant goals of the movement, there remains a need for tutelas: in recent years, 27% of people living with HIV have still claimed being denied some form of care, and the deep fragmentation that marks the system causes some to be unable to successfully navigate the care to which they are entitled.", "qa": [["69_13905063_4_1", "What are some of the reasons why certain HIV activists did not feel comfortable working with the pharmaceutical industry?\n", "Some HIV activists did not feel comfortable working with the pharmaceutical industry because they saw it as the reason for Colombia's unusually high costs of care.

These wind speeds and surge heights were next used in Impact Forecasting's ELEMENTS program to estimate the potential insurable losses caused by the hurricane.\n\n The Impact Forecasting wind field model is a spectral-based parametric model that solves equations of motion by using the finite difference method. The wind field model has been calibrated, both spatially and temporally, to the surface winds. The wind speed footprint, as modeled by Impact Forecasting, for Hurricane Harvey is presented on the right. This footprint has general agreements with the wind speed swath from the NHC.\n\n Inland Flood (Riverine & Flash Flood) Given the substantial rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey, Impact Forecasting additionally ran its inland flood model. The inland flood results show areas impacted by both pluvial (flash flood) and fluvial (riverine) flooding and were constructed using Impact Forecasting's 1D riverine and 2D hydrodynamic rainfall-runoff model. In order to run the model, real-time stream gauge discharge observations were collected for the impacted regions. Due to a number of stream gauges failing during the peak of the event, corrections were made in order to include them in the calibration process.\n\n Some areas recorded rainfall rates with an estimated return period in excess of 1,000 years. This means that there was a 0.1 percent chance (1/1,000 probability) that the recorded rainfall would occur at any given location in any year. Given the rainfall rates, Impact Forecasting used pre-calculated return period flash flood events to construct the Harvey rainfall extent. The final inland flood extents are shown on the next page. From an insurance point of view, as mentioned previously, the relative lack of NFIP coverage in some of the hardest-hit areas meant that an abnormally high portion of economic damage caused by flooding was not covered by insurance. Hurricanes have historically shown a roughly 50 percent ratio of insured-toeconomic loss damage. However, hurricane losses that are primarily driven by coastal or inland flood tend to show lower percentages of coverage. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 only had roughly 40 percent of the overall economic cost covered by public and private insurance entities as most of the damage resulted from considerable inland flooding in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\n Insured losses resulting from Harvey were thus also significantly less than the overall economic cost. At roughly USD30 billion, this meant that only 30 percent of the financial cost was covered by public and private insurers. This was almost entirely due to most of the damage resulting from extreme flooding in the Houston metro area, as opposed to wind. A statement from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program cited that claims payouts were well into the billions, and could reach as high as USD11 billion. Additional losses were incurred by the onshore and offshore energy industry.\n\n Harvey was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Texas. It surpassed Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Ike cost the United States at least USD35 billion in economic damage; while public and private insurers paid more than USD20 billion (2017 USD). It also far surpassed losses from 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -which was previously considered the worst flood event in Houston's recorded history. In fact, Harvey's rainfall surpassed Allison in nearly half the time (2-3 days compared to five days). Allison cost an estimated USD12 billion in economic damage (2017 USD). Less than half of that cost (USD5.0 billion, 2017 USD) was covered by insurance.\n\n Bottom line: Hurricane Harvey was one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history, second only to 2005's Hurricane Katrina. The full scope and magnitude of the damage and humanitarian impact was enormous and the economic impact was substantial.\n\n In terms of tropical cyclone development, the official Atlantic Hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 -though tropical cyclones have been known to develop during any month. As seen in the graphics below, the most likely months for cyclogenesis are during the peak months of August, September, and October. During these months, atmospheric and oceanic conditions are climatologically the most conducive for cyclones being influenced and/or steered by a strong Atlantic ridge of high pressure and/or by the advancement of strong troughs that dig into the central and eastern United States.\n\n The caveat to cyclogenesis is, of course, the eventual track of storms that do develop.

A typical aging brain displays signs of cell atrophy, which most likely are related to 3 main mechanisms, as explained in the Introduction, i.e., decline in blood flow and supply, mitochondrial dysfunction (caused by oxidative stress), and increased inflammation. The brain of a patient with AD ages similarly, but there are small differences, such as the presence of NFTs and b-amyloid plaques (7) . There are several possible mechanisms that might act on these factors and explain the positive effects of the MD on cognitive function.\n\n The first is by decreasing vascular risk factors and thus improving blood flow to the brain. There is strong evidence to show that adherence to the MD reduces vascular risk factors such as LDL cholesterol and increases favorable HDL cholesterol (12) . The largest to date RCT on the MD, the PREDIMED study showed that greater adherence to the MD caused a 30% reduction in RR of a major cardiovascular event (63) . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) also is strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction (64) . However, Scarmeas et al. (65) showed that adjusting for vascular disease risk factors virtually kept the protective effect of the MD on AD unchanged, suggesting that these factors only play a small role in this association.\n\n Second, the MD may exert protective effects on cognition through its effect on oxidative stress. The MD is known for being a rich source of antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, and polyphenols (61) . Mouse studies have shown that antioxidant supplementation, such as with vitamin E, lowers lipid oxidation products, increases intrinsic antioxidant activity, and improves mitochondrial function and cognitive performance (66) . Epidemiologic studies suggest that vitamin E is protective against cognitive disorders (67) , but a large human trial that assessed the effect of vitamin E on progression from MCI to AD found no difference compared with placebo (68) . The findings of RCTs that used supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin B-12, and folate also were inconsistent (69, 70) , suggesting that some of the benefits of nutrients might be due to synergistic effects or mediated by nutrient-nutrient interactions (70) . In addition, it is possible that any potential benefits of supplementation are evident only in those who are deficient or have a low intake of a nutrient, such as in the case of folate (71) .\n\n Third, the effect of the MD on cognitive function may be mediated through lowering inflammation in the brain. The MD was shown to lower inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in neuritic plaques and NFTs in the brains and serum of AD patients (47) . As found by Gu et al. (53) , participants with the highest MD adherence had significantly lower high-sensitivity CRP concentration.", "qa": [["55_179535_5_1", "How does adherence to the Mediterranean Diet potentially improve cognitive function?\n", "Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) may improve cognitive function through several mechanisms.

In the present study, we demonstrate modest but significant reductions in triglyceride concentration in conjunction with improvements in insulin sensitivity using a lipolytic blocking agent, acipimox, in HIV-infected patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n Previous research investigating lipid metabolism in HIVinfected patients, particularly in the setting of lipodystrophy (lipoatrophy and/or central adipose accumulation), showed increased rates of lipolysis and FFA release from adipose tissue (10, 12) . Reeds et al. (11) also noted that HIV-infected men with dyslipidemia had increased FFA release, measured as the Ra of palmitate, as well as decreased very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride clearance, compared with agematched healthy controls.

Therefore, suppression of lipolysis, reductions in FFA, and potential improvement in triglyceride clearance with acipimox is a rational therapeutic approach to HIV-associated hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n In the current study, 3 months of acipimox was associated with significant suppression of lipolysis and a 68% reduction in circulating FFAs. This was accompanied by a median triglyceride reduction of 48 mg/dl in subjects receiving acipimox and significant improvements in insulin sensitivity. Similar to the observations of Bajaj et al. (20) , who used acipimox in adults with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes, we also identified a strong inverse relationship between changes in plasma FFAs and improvements in whole-body glucose disposal. We observed an improvement of approximately 30% in M after 12 wk, and Bajaj et al. (20) found an 18% improvement in glucose disposal after 7 d of acipimox administration. These data are also consistent with observations on the short-term use of acipimox to reduce insulin levels in association with reduced FFA levels in obese adults (14) .\n\n Two open-label trials of an extended-release niacin prep-aration in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia reported significant reductions in triglycerides (30, 31) . There was a substantial increase in homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index, one of the measured indices of insulin resistance in one study (30) , but Dube et al. (31) showed that early increases in glucose at 12 wk were transient and did not persist at 24 or 48 wk. The chronic use of nicotinic acid has been associated with rebound of plasma FFAs, and previously its use in diabetes has been limited due to potential deleterious effects on glucose control. However, the use of lower-dose, extended-release preparations of niacin (1000 -1500 mg/d), which may avoid this rebound rise in FFAs, reduces triglycerides, increases HDL cholesterol, and has not consistently been associated with worsened glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (32) . Acipimox has a longer half-life than nicotinic acid, and in the dosing regimen of 250 mg three times daily, it has not been associated with worsened glucose metabolism. Fulcher et al.

Arterial remodeling is an adaptive process that attempts to return high or low WSS back to a physiological baseline of 15-20 dynes/ cm 2 . 25 Vascular remodeling is characterized by vascular SMC (VSMC) apoptosis and migration, degradation of the ECM, and inflammation causing local dilation and thin-\n\n Flowchart outlining the different hemodynamic factors that lead to aneurysm formation and rupture. Aneurysm formation occurs in a manner distinct from aneurysm rupture, with two proposed mechanisms for explaining vessel wall remodeling and eventual rupture.

In contrast, the low-WSS theory suggests an inflammatory mechanism involving hyperplasia and atherosclerosis.

Vortex core lines (yellow) and neighboring streamline trajectories (red) are used to visualize the spatial structure of the flow at two instants during the cardiac cycle.

The lower aneurysm, with large fluctuations in its spatial structure, would have a high OSI. ning of the vessel wall (Fig. 4) . 28, 52 Additionally, the biological interactions of flow and vessel wall remodeling that initiate aneurysm formation is a distinct process from the growth and rupture of an already formed aneurysm.\n\n In the presence of hemodynamic stressors, flow-dependent NO release inhibits the proliferation of VSMCs and can initiate apoptosis by activating caspase 3. This results in pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and cell death. In addition, physical stretch on the vessel wall can induce apoptosis by activation of the tumor suppressor p53. Primarily found in the medial layer, VSMC migration is a normal response in the setting of vascular injury. Hemodynamic stimuli may alter migratory signals such as amines, peptide growth factors, cytokines, and ECM components, such that migration contributes to vessel wall thinning. 52 Migration of VSMCs is in the direction of the intima, with a subsequent phenotypic reprogramming mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and Kruppel-like transcription factor 4. VSMCs gain the ability to express genes related to upregulation of proinflammatory molecules including MMPs, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and interleukin (IL). 56 Within the intimal layer, these cells can proliferate and synthesize new matrix and fibrous tissue, resulting in the process known as intimal hyperplasia. Normally a part of the wound-healing process, decellularized areas characterized by loss of mural cells, matrix breakdown, and hyalinization resembling fibrinoid necrosis have been detected in rupture-prone aneurysms. 19 The disappearance of the IEL is among the first histological changes observed during aneurysmal growth, leaving the adventitia as the only layer resisting transmural   FIG. 4 .

Completion thyroidectomy is usually done when a diagnostic thyroid lobectomy or lobectomy is performed for what was thought to be a benign disease such as symptomatic multinodular goiter reveals a differentiated thyroid carcinoma on histopathological examination. 1 In most cases, post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia is temporary, but may take several months to resolve.

Early-stage cervical cancer can be successfully treated by surgery. However, most cervical cancers develop in women who do not undergo The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with cisplatin [3] . Although CCRT reduces the rates of local and distant recurrence and improves disease-free survival, the recurrence rate is still high in patients with very large or advanced-stage tumors. In contrast to early-stage cervical cancer, which is usually treated by radical hysterectomy, there is a lack of pathologic parameters in patients with LACC who are treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT). Establishment of reliable prognostic or predictive markers is necessary for identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy.\n\n Cancer outcomes are not only determined by tumor characteristics but are also influenced by patient-related factors [4] . A variety of host-related features have been implicated as prognostic factors for cancer-related survival including age, weight loss, performance status, and immune response. According to immunosurveillance theory, lymphocytes operate as guards against cancer by identifying and destroying malignant cells [5] . Compared to healthy women, those with cervical cancer have lower peripheral lymphocyte counts [6] .\n\n Both young age and low pretreatment lymphocyte counts have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with cervical cancer.

Pretreatment lymphocyte count has been shown to independently predict treatment outcomes in patients with LACC who are treated using RT or CCRT [8, 9] . Pretreatment leukocytosis and neutrophilia also have been demonstrated to have an independent prognostic impact in these patients. A combination of these hematological parameters that represent the systemic inflammatory response, such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), has been demonstrated to have substantial prognostic value in cervical cancer [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although the prognostic role of NLR has been confirmed by several studies, it has not yet been incorporated into clinical practice. Another hematologic marker, the lymphocyte-to-white blood cell (WBC) ratio (lymphocyte percentage), was also found to have prognostic value in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma [19] [20] [21] .

When we set the other definitions for EHEC O157 infection, we could not obtain a clear indication of the source (data not shown). Of the patients who were culture-positive for both EHEC O111 (or its stx2-negative variant) and EHEC O157, the rate of HUS development was higher than that of a previously reported group [22] . Our findings do not support the theory that EHEC O157 was the major contributor to the development of HUS because the rate of HUS development in the EHEC O157-only culture-positive cases was low (1/18 in Watahiki et al. [22] ). At this point, it is not clear why a doubly-positive patient developed severe complications.\n\n Our data showed that the risk factors for complications were female sex and age groups 5-9 and 15-19 years. Another investigation also indicated that female sex was associated with the development of severe complications [31] . The implications of this association may point to a sex difference in Gb3 (stx receptor) on human cells. We attempted to analyse HUS stratified by sex and age group but were unsuccessful due to the small numbers in each group.\n\n The factors significantly associated with HUS and AE include sex, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting (Table 3) . Moreover, in this outbreak investigation symptoms such as fever, seizure, and headache were also significantly associated with diagnoses of HUS and AE. In previous E. coli outbreaks, sex and bloody stool were significantly associated with HUS [13, [31] [32] [33] [34] . One of the strengths of this outbreak investigation was that we obtained detailed information about symptoms. Consequently, the clinical outline of severe complications could be obtained via pathological imaging findings (MRI or computed tomography).

In addition, although elaborate bacteriological testing was conducted in laboratories and by the TIH, some cases may have been unconfirmed due to a lack of laboratory testing in the isolation of E. coli O111, because it is currently difficult to isolate EHEC in routine laboratory settings, especially in the case of stx-negative variants.

Severe complications such as HUS and AE occurred not only in young children (aged <5 years), but also in other age groups. Severe complications such as HUS and AE and the case-fatality rate were much higher in this outbreak.

After 4 hours, with better clarification, there was a great amount of thick, hyaline tortuous, coenocytic right-angled hyphae, with no perfect parallel walls suggesting tissue invasion by Mucorales.\n\n Culture -After 24 hours in all incubated plates the tissue fragment and the area of agar 3 cm around were covered by clear web like mycelium with radiated margins. At the microscope (400x) it seemed steril with an intense cytoplasmatic flux inside the coenocytic hyphae. After 4 days the plates were totally covered by an elevated cotton-like; brownishgray mycelium with small dark points. The slide culture showed sporangia with no or slightly branching, emerging in opposition to poor develloped rhizoids, which is characteristic of Rhizopus sp. IILslopatlioIORy -There was extensive ne crosis of skin and subcutaneous fat with acute Inflammation. Scattered among the polymor phonuclear neutrophils were numerous broad non septated right angled branching hyphae easily recognized in the hematoxylin cosin stain ed slides <Fig. 1, C, Dh Special staining by Grocott methenamine silver nitrate technique emphasized the contrast between the fungus and the tissue. There was no vascular invasion in sections.\n\n Evolution -After the results from the direct mycological examination, the patient re ceived amphotericin B by venous route and local therapeutics with 1.5% amphotericin B cream. After completing 75 mg of systemic ad ministration the diabetes was compensated, showing blood glucose of 173 mg/100 ml and normal arterial gases. The tissue specimens still showed the presence of hyphae on histo logical and mycological examinations.\n\n After completing 725 mg of amphotericin B the levels of blood urea and serum creatinin were ele vated and the drug was interrupted. The dia betes again showed ketoacidosis. After correct ing the ketoacidosis and the reintroduction of amphotericin B, a progressive change in ulce ration was noticed with development of gra nulation tissue and no secretion.\n\n Two months after admission, after a total dose of 1,775 mg of amphotericin B and daily 40 units of NPH insulin, diabetes was controled and the cutaneous lesion reduced to 5 x 3 cm with granulation tissue, and the patient was clinically well.\n\n Ten rolls of elastic opened or not adhesive bands from several areas in the hospital were sectioned with sterile scissors in small strips and placed on the surface of Sabouraud dextro se agar. To ensure contact with the agar, the strips were moistened with a small amount of 5% sterile glucose solution. After one week in cubation, several contaminant fungi were grown, but none was identified as Mucorales.\n\n Eight plates of Sabouraud dextrose agar were settled in the room were the patient stay ed, during a period of 6 hours, coincidentally with the most active work hours. After seven days incubation several contaminant fungi ha ve grown and in two plates of the same room, together with colonies of P\u00e9nicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp.; there was the development of Rhizopus oryzae.\n\n According to reports on mucormycosis 2 , the primary invasion of the skin and subcuta neous tissue by Mucorales occurs in less than 10% of the cases.

The marked rate of onset of acute pulmonary oedema, requiring respiratory support and high dependency unit care in a patient with excellent premorbid function and in the absence of cardiac disease, raises the question, whether preoperative assessment of cardiac function should be considered prior to procedure.\n\n Awareness of the risk of systemic vasopressin absorption and potential cardiac sequelae including bradycardia, hypotension and coronary artery vasospasm will facilitate the speed of recognition and initiation of treatment, to ensure prompt resolution.\n\n On review of the literature regarding complications associated with intramyometrial vasopressin use, this is the first case demonstrating acute pulmonary oedema, requiring respiratory support. There are a number of cases, which have demonstrated significant haemodynamic instability, thought to be related to systemic absorption of vasopressin. This case highlighted the variation in dose and constitution of vasopressin in use worldwide and the absence of clear national guidance on safe vasopressin doses. The evidence supports efficacy at lower vasopressin doses than used in this case. This case highlights the need for clear national guidance on dosage and constitution, to ensure ongoing safe use of vasopressin.\n\n A 34-year-old female patient, with no significant past medical history (62 kg) underwent a routine laparoscopic myomectomy for a single, pedunculated fibroid. The main indication for surgery was significant pressure symptoms affecting her bladder. She had no previous surgical or medical history. She had never been pregnant. She took no regular medication and had no known allergies. She has been fasting from midnight the day prior to the procedure. She was counselled about the risks of surgery, including the potential to convert to an open procedure and proceeding to a hysterectomy, in the event of a complication. She was happy to proceed. She was assessed and consented by the anaesthetic consultant and was deemed to be American Society of Anaesthetists (ASA) grade 1. The anaesthetic consent also included any unexpected incidences related to other surgery or the anaesthetic and this was documented.\n\n The patient had an uneventful awake, singleattempt spinal anaesthetic, with bupivacaine (2 mL, 0.5%) and diamorphine (750 \u03bcg). General anaesthetic was straight-forward, induction with intravenous propofol (200 mg) and atracurium (35 mg) and anaesthetic maintenance was with desflurane aimed at a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1.1. She was ventilated on synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation-volume guarantee mode, with a respiratory rate of 12-15/min, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH 2 O, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH 2 O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 30%.\n\n Laparoscopic entry with veres needle was uncomplicated with an opening pressure of 6 mm Hg and a pneumoperitoneum to 20 mm Hg. Primary trochar entry with a 10 mm port was routine; two further lateral ports (5 and 10 mm) were inserted under direct vision. Intramyometrial vasopressin (20 IU) into the stalk of the fibroid was used routinely to facilitate vasoconstriction and reduce blood loss. An episode of sinus bradycardia (heart rate 30) associated with significant hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 45 mm Hg) immediately followed unexpected outcome (positive or negative) including adverse drug reactions vasopressin infiltration. The bradycardia was treated promptly with ephedrine (6 mg), followed by glycopyrrolate (200 \u03bcg) and a 500 mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid (plasmalyte). The desflurane rate was reduced and the oxygen concentration was turned up. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements were taken every minute and central pulse was monitored until blood pressure normalised. The patient was in the head down position, under the operative drapes, with the forced air warming device maintaining her temperature. Intraoperatively she also received intravenous paracetamol (1 g), ondansetron (4 mg), amoxicillin (1.2 g), tranexamic acid (1 g) and 2 L of crystalloid fluid (Plasmalyte) in total.

This disease is thought to usually begin in the rectum and extends to involve all or part of the remaining colon. The histopathological features of UCare characterized by two major features (17). One is architectural distortion ofcolonic crypt with frequent depletion of goblet cell mucin and the other is diffuse inflammation with mucosal infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. In the active stage of UC, aggregates of neutrophils near and invading the crypt epithelium form crypt abscesses and massive infiltration of neutrophils in the colonic lamina propria is observed.\n\n IL-8, Neutrophils, and Reactive Oxygen in UC Neutrophils are the first cells that migrate into tissues in response to invading pathogens. Therefore, their main role in inflammatory and immune responses has been thought to be the phagocytosis and killing of bacteria through reactive oxygen metabolites and the release of lytic enzymesstored in granules (18) .\n\n Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs)are involved in inflammatory diseases and are reported to injure the intestinal epithelial cells in vitro (19). The hydroxyl radical is more injurious for cellular injury of the intestinal epithelium than superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Neutrophils have been shown to produce hypochlorous acid which is a myeloperoxidase-derived product. Many studies on UCand Crohn's disease have shownthat excessive ROMs are generated by peripheral blood leukocytes and inflamed colonic mucosa (20-22). These ROMswere produced by monocytes and neutrophils. Simmondset al have proposed that neutrophilderived oxidants (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and hypochloride) are generated in the colorectal mucosa of active inflammatory bowel disease and that luminoldependent chemiluminescenceis correlated with microscopic inflammation (23).\n\n Our results showedthat luminol-dependent chemiluminescence in active UCmucosa was higher than that in inactive UC mucosa and controls, but it did not correlate with activity grades of colonoendoscopic findings. The addition of sodium azide, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor, to the media of inflamed mucosal scrapings significantly decreased their chemiluminescence, suggesting that most of the chemiluminescence is derived from the myeloperoxidase system (23, 24). Myeloperoxidase activity is derived primarily from neutrophils and partly from monocyteswell correlated with acute intestinal inflammation (24).\n\n Therefore, myeloperoxidase activity is used as one of the indicators of neutrophil infiltration. As myeloperoxidase is a stable substance and an enzymatic protein which is found in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we measured the myeloperoxidase levels in the media of organ cultures of mucosal biopsy specimens by using an EIA method in place of myeloperoxidase activity, because myeloperoxidase activity is partly inhibited by 5-aminosalicylic acid and corticosteroids as mentioned in Methods.", "qa": [["44_23213677_2_1", "What are the main histopathological features of ulcerative colitis (UC) and what role do neutrophils play in the inflammatory response?\n", "The main histopathological features of UC are architectural distortion of colonic crypts with frequent depletion of goblet cell mucin and diffuse inflammation with mucosal infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils.
