Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Intestinal iron absorption is thus blocked (Fig. 3) . Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Data remain limited across Europe, 6 but emerging research demonstrates large variations in the prevalence of a range of long-term conditions, such as diabetes 7, 8 and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 9 These chronic diseases present a particular challenge for migrant and ethnic minority populations, who in many instances experience a higher burden of disease, but have paradoxically been marginalized from preventive behaviour change interventions, 2, 5, 10 which tend to originate from a Eurocentric perspective. 3 These interventions address causative lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity and diet and are henceforth referred to as lifestyle interventions.\n\n Lifestyle interventions are increasingly required to be informed by evidence-based guidelines. As such, it is important that guidelines consider the needs of diverse ethnic groups as, if not taken into account, interventions may be rendered inequitable in reach and/or impact, and may actually widen preexisting inequalities in health. 11, 12 We were commissioned to undertake a mixed methods programme of research to examine how lifestyle interventions can be best adapted to increase their salience and effectiveness for ethnic minority groups. 13 This work commenced with a detailed assessment of UK guidelines and international systematic reviews on lifestyle interventions of proven effectiveness, recommended population-wide. In this article, we report and discuss the degree to which ethnic minority populations were considered within these guidelines and systematic reviews.\n\n \n\n \n\n The full text of all eligible records was retrieved; there were no language restrictions and 12 full-text articles were translated into English from Danish, French, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish by colleagues at The University of Edinburgh to adequately assess their eligibility.\n\n Both reviewers independently screened and selected records for inclusion according to predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The population of focus was a general population (of any age), nonclinical and with no special focus (e.g. not pregnant or menopausal, nor of specific socio-economic status (SES), ethnicity, religion or gender). However, reviews or guidelines were not excluded if they contained individual studies that included special populations.\n\n Any lifestyle intervention that promoted smoking cessation, physical activity and/or improving nutrition and had effective outcome measures related to these behaviours were included (individual, community, population, and policy-level interventions).\n\n The aim was to extract interventions with a strong enough evidence base to be recommended for implementation. Owing to the maturity of the evidence in the field of smoking cessation we included only recommendations with strong evidence of effectiveness. For physical activity and nutrition because, in general, this body of evidence was at an earlier stage of development, we included recommendations with strong/moderate evidence of effectiveness.\n\n Exclusions included pharmaceutical and surgical interventions; also physical activity interventions aimed exclusively at preventing falls or solely measuring weight loss outcomes.\n\n Disagreements in the selection of evidence were resolved through discussion between the two reviewers, with arbitration by a third reviewer when necessary (A.S.). To assess consideration of ethnicity, we searched this body of evidence for statements or relevant data (e.g. subgroup analysis) specifically addressing ethnicity. The full text was searched either electronically (or manually if electronic versions were unavailable) using a set of key terms 13 reflecting the ethnic groups of interest, and more broadly encompassing the concept of ethnicity (e.g. rac*, minorit*). The key terms used are included in Figure 1 . In our broader work we undertook a considered discussion of the definition of ethnicity, 13 which can be complex and contested, and adopted a definition widely accepted in public health, 14 which acknowledges its 'imprecise and fluid' nature and includes the related concepts of race and nationality.\n\n 14 Although identifying any consideration of ethnicity for selection, we were primarily interested in ethnic minority groups, defined as ethnic groups residing in countries where they represented a minority population.\n\n The key terms identified were examined to determine if they were mentioned in isolation or as part of a statement relating to ethnicity.

Of this total $8 million was congressionally earmarked for use against infectious disease -specifically, $4 million for tuberculosis prevention and control and $4 million for malaria prevention and control. To ensure that these and any future infectious disease funds maximally contribute to achieving the health goal of USAID/ Afghanistan and are used in accordance with Congressional intentions the following document-a strategic framework for action against TB and malaria-was developed by a team of technical experts 1 during a two week visit to Afghanistan-December 3-16, 2003 . The framework emphasizes that these resources must be used in those areas of Afghanistan where these diseases represent public health burdens. In the case of malaria this means that REACH supported malaria activities should be focused in the 9 of the 13 REACH provinces which have documented cases (see map). TB, on the other hand, has been shown to be prevalent in all13 provinces. As a core operating principal of this framework, however, both TB and malaria resources need not be limited to a specialized disease focus when considering the needs for expanding systems, improving quality of services, and contributing to enhanced community outreach. These resources should be seen as capable of contributing to the broader goals of the BPHS.\n\n The major recommendations made to USAID/REACH by the team are summarized below:\n\n 1. As part of its ongoing support to the Country Coordinating Mechanism for the Global Fund for the Fight Against AIDS, TB and Malaria (GF ATM) USAID/REACH should continue to support the posting of a dedicated staff person to the CCM. This arrangement has made an invaluable contribution to the efforts of CCM and will become increasing more valuable as activities supported by the Round 2 award move forward. 2. USAID/REACH should make a special effort to document the lessons in the 13 USAID/REACH provinces on how to best deliver TB and malaria services within the BPHS. These \"best practices\" should in turn be shared with the CCM to guide GFA TM-financed expanded delivery ofTB and malaria services. 3. To ensure adequate 'stewardship\" the MOHand to contribute to the successful integration of TB and malaria into the BPHS USAID/REACH should actively support, through short-term technical assistance, the National Programs for TB and Malaria efforts to develop and disseminate national policies, norms, and guidelines for TB and Malaria 4. As part of its commitment to strengthening the National TB Program (NTB) USAID/REACH should consider hiring a dedicated, long-term REACH staff person to assist the NTB team plan, manage, coordinate, monitor and supervise the NTP integration into and implementation of the BPHS. USAID/REACH should also consider direct support to the National Malaria Program. 5. In the past, USAID/Afghanistan provided support to the malaria program through a grant with WHO-that has been instrumental in strengthening key aspects of the capacity of the national program. In the future it is recommended that USAID/REACH explore options for continuing such support. 6. As part of its commitment to systems strengthening USAID/REACH is encouraged to support the development of a human capacity development plan for implementation of TB and Malaria within the BPHS -with particular attention to enhancing the roles of nurses throughout the system 1 Dennis Carroll, Senior Infectious Disease Advisor and Team Leader, USAID; Christine Whalen, Director TB and HIV/AIDS Unit, MSH; Paul Arnow, Infectious Diseases Advisor, MSH 7. As part ofUSAID/REACH commitment to a core TOT capacity (in support of the delivery of the BPHS) particular emphasis needs to be given to ensuring this capacity includes training packages for in TB and malaria service delivery 8. At the same time USAID/REACH together with the MOHand WHO should consider the development of decentralized regional training centers for TB (Kabul, Badakshan, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Bamyan) where sub-national teams presently exist. 9. To ensure the technical and programmatic competency of REACH supported NGOs, USAID/REACH needs to support a \"state of the art\" training in DOTS expansion and malaria prevention and control. REACH needs to ensure that the NGOs who have received funding also receive training in DOTS expansion from the provincial teams cited in recommendation #8 ..

In the advanced stage, plain radiographs may show diffuse swelling, erosion of the underlying bone or radiopaque densities, depending on the degree of calcification or ossification. If the cartilaginous bodies were not calcified, it would create a problem in the diagnosis of the lesion. This occurs in about one-third of cases. 3, 6, 7) Associated radiological features are the erosion of bone, occasional osteoarthritis, and regional osteoporosis. For cases in which radiolucent bodies are present, computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans may be able to identify the lesions. CT scans can detect erosions that may not be seen radiographically. 8) MRI scans can demonstrate non-calcified and non-ossified chondral bodies, and identify the size and extent of the lesion. Three different MRI patterns were identified in synovial chondromatosis. 7) Pattern A was characterized by a lobulated homogeneous intraarticular signal that was isointense or slightly hyperintense on a T1-weighted image, and hyperintense on a T2-weighted image. Plain films in patients with pattern A showed no calcification. Pattern B is the most common pattern. It was similar to pattern A; in addition, it was characterized by focal areas of signal void on all imaging sequences. These areas corresponded to foci of calcification on plain film. Pattern C had similar features to those of patterns A and B, but included foci of peripheral low signal surrounding central areas characteristic of fat. Plain film and CT scans in these patients revealed multiple foci of calcification and ossification.\n\n The differential diagnoses include rheumatoid disease, osteochondritis dissecans, crystal arthropathy, tuberculous arthritis, trauma-related osteochondral proliferations, periosteal chondroma, synovial sarcoma, psoriatic arthropathy, pigmented villonodular synovitis and degenerative joint disease.\n\n Milgram 9) described three stages of the disease. Phase 1 consists of active synovial disease with no free or loose bodies, phase 2 has both active synovial disease and loose bodies in the synovial tissue and in the joint cavity or bursa, and phase 3 consists of multiple osteochondral loose bodies without active synovial disease.\n\n Synovial chondromatosis typically affects a single large joint. The appearance of this lesion in the wrist is exceptionally rare, with some cases in the distal radioulnar joint appearing in the literature. However, cases involving the pisotriquetral joint is extremely rare in the literature. As a result of the rarity of synovial chondromatosis in the pisotriquetral joint, other diseases including infection, tenosynovitis, autoimmune disease, triangular fibrocartilage pathology are suspected at first. The comparatively high prevalence of other conditions in this region, combined with a low index of suspicion of synovial chondromatosis, may result in a failure to diagnose the condition and to provide the appropriate treatment. Due to the fact that no calcification or ossification of the cartilage occurs in roughly one-third of cases, making a radiographical diagnosis of synovial chondromatosis is difficult. In these cases, MRI would appear to be an ideal method for the evaluation of synovial chondromatosis.\n\n The presence of intraarticular bodies can lead to degenerative arthritis with associated pain and loss of function, and spontaneous regression is rare.

First, similar to all published studies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, the crosssectional study design precludes us from examining exactly the role of each class of antiretroviral agent in the development of metabolic syndrome. Second, the hospital where the study was conducted is a major referral hospital for HIV care in greater Taipei. Over the past decade, 7402 patients who were newly diagnosed with HIV infections in greater Taipei according to statistics of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 5521 (74.6%) being sexually transmitted, were reported to the Taiwan CDC. Of these, 3555 (48.0%) sought HIV care at this hospital. While the proportion of our adult patients (55.1%; 1777/3223) who were started on HAART was similar to that of all HIV-infected patients in Taiwan according to the Taiwan CDC (55%) (C.-H. Yang, Taiwan CDC, personal communication), a previous history of antiretroviral treatment may not be complete in many patients who were referred from other hospitals. Therefore the effects of antiretroviral drugs on metabolic syndrome may have been underestimated or overestimated in our study and our findings may not be generalizable to the entire population of HIV-infected adults in Taiwan. Third, 75.2% of the subjects enrolled in this study were male homosexuals, and only a small number of them were injecting drug users (IDUs; 3.9%), which is different from the epidemiology of the 17282 cases of HIV infections reported to the Taiwan CDC as of April 2009 in which 39.27% were male homosexuals. However, IDUs were either incarcerated or lost to follow-up after release from correctional facilities or prisons, and it was estimated that ,5% of IDUs continued to receive HAART. Although the distribution and trends of risks for HIV transmission in our cohort over the past decade were similar to those of all HIV-infected patients who were not IDUs in Taiwan, the findings of our study may not be generalizable to other HIV care facilities with a higher proportion of IDUs in Taiwan. Fourth, information on potential confounding factors that may influence metabolic syndrome, such as alcoholic intake, dietary habit and physical activity, were not collected during the study period. The reported prevalences of metabolic syndrome in different studies among different ethnic groups range widely, from 17.0% to 45.4%; 16 -25 therefore, not only antiretroviral therapy, but alcohol intake, dietary habit and physical activity, may play a role.\n\n In conclusion, our study demonstrates a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among HIV-infected patients who are ethnic Chinese.

Each response is built de novo by the immune components that swarm into the site. The challenge agents provide important information to the immune system, but they are not the only source of information at the challenge site. Equally important is the nature of the challenge site itself. For example, some sites, such as the eye, are nonpermissive for virtually all immune responses. Other sites may be nonpermissive for selected types of immune responses. Presumably, this reflects the degree of compatibility between a particular immune response option and local tissue function. In general, the choice of local immune response options reflects a compromise between the agenda of the immune system and the physiologic agenda of the tissues at the challenge site. The immune system does not necessarily build the optimal immune response. It builds the best response that it can under the conditions present at the specific location. Thus, 2 different tissues could simultaneously develop very dissimilar immune responses to the same challenge agent. In this way, the information available at the local level of the immune response is critical. Together, the challenge agents and the local site conditions provide a unique set of information to the swarm participants, which, in turn, use this information to select from among their available response options to build an immune response. The selection of a specific option provides more local information to the swarm participants, and this iterative process of information generation and transmission permits the evolution of the local immune response. This process of information flow is pure immuno-informatics.\n\n Information transfer occurs via cell-to-cell communication during every phase of the immune responses. Communication can occur via a wide range of direct (cell-cell contact) or indirect (cell contact with secreted mediators) mechanisms. Ultimately, this information helps the leukocyte swarm to (1) localize to the appropriate site in the body, (2) recognize formative features of the local situation, (3) develop appropriate immune effector mechanisms, and (4) disassemble when its goals have been met.\n\n It should be noted that response options can range from eradication of the challenge agent to its acceptance and incorporation into the organism. Thus, the immune response must involve a decisionmaking process that determines how best to deal\n\n The study of the principles by which the immune system deals with, and benefits from, its own complexity. with the challenge agent with regard to the broader interests of the body. Furthermore, feedback information must be generated as the immune response develops that allows the immune system to determine whether it is making progress toward the implementation of its decision. Immune decision making, strategy development, and strategy appraisal are all important aspects of immuno-informatics. Clearly, vast amounts of information are generated and traded among members of leukocyte swarms and leukocyte hives during immune responses. Swarm members also trade information with resident cells of the challenged tissues. Indeed, the amount of information traded concurrently during an immune response is daunting. This fact raises problems, both for the immune system and for its investigators. Virtually all immunologists appreciate that leukocytes communicate through cytokines, chemokines, and costimulators, but most study these communications as infobytes rather than as an integrative, information-sharing conversation among leukocyte swarm members and the tissues that they visit. Indeed, the linguistics of the immune system remain obscure and are worthy of study in their own right. Furthermore, it is unclear how the multiple, simultaneous conversations that occur at a challenge site remain coherent and do not degenerate into chaos-generating babble. This is an immuno-ecologic issue. One principle that apparently governs this aspect of immune function is conditional reception, the selective expression receptors in various situations. This effectively allows cells to \"listen\" to one conversation at a time. The operation and value of this working principle has been discussed elsewhere. \n\n Of course, leukocyte swarms are composed of hordes of individual leukocytes, each generating and responding to selected sets of information. How each one obtains, processes, and responds to this information has been the primary focus of conventional immunologic investigation. It is only when investigators consider the behavior of large numbers of heterogeneous, interactive leukocytes that understanding is quickly lost. Leukocyte population behavior within tissues is the frontier of modern immunology.\n\n The behavior of individual leukocytes is similar to that of colonial insects. Like ants and bees, individual leukocytes are endowed with a set of genetically defined behavior patterns, each of which they deploy conditionally when the correct environmental stimuli are encountered. Their responses are thoughtless, reflexive, choreographed, and performed without hesitation. The immediate microenvironment provides the selective stimuli (information) needed to alter the behavior of each leukocyte. In the absence of such stimuli, leukocytes simply continue their current behavior. Thus, individual leukocytes are slaves to the information presented by the immediate environment. Given the list of cues and responses, the behavior of individual leukocytes is totally predictable. Leukocytes do not consider options or ponder consequences. They act unhesitatingly without concern for their own well-being or the well-being of others. Each operates as an expendable, mindless automaton with no personal worth, no personal agenda, and no personal understanding of the overall situation.\n\n What makes this system work is the virtually unlimited number of leukocytes available to it, and the huge numbers of leukocytes that are recruited into each swarm process. The loss or malfunction of an individual is relatively inconsequential because others readily compensate it. Although each individual may perform only a small part of a task, hordes of individuals operating together can perform big jobs. They may be inefficient, but they are reliable. Of interest is the fact that they do so with no leaders and with no blueprints. Under these conditions, leadership and plans are unnecessary. Thus, information related to these categories is unnecessary. Furthermore, complex tasks can evolve in a coordinated fashion when the workers add new stimuli (information) to the environment through completion of their initial tasks. This process induces new behaviors that build on previous behaviors. Highly complex tasks can be accomplished in this manner. However, the progression of these tasks depends completely on the availability of components and operational information within the local environment. These influence the choices made at each step in the process and, thus, guide the direction in which the task evolves. A missing component is rarely a problem, since the net-\n\n The study of the principles by which the immune system generates, posts, processes, and stores information.", "qa": [["30_55392963_1_1", "How does the immune system evaluate and respond to an immune challenge at a specific site in the body?", "The immune system evaluates and responds to an immune challenge at a specific site in the body by building a response based on the information provided by the challenge agents and the local site conditions.

This scale differs slightly from those suggested by other authors, 7,20 but we chose anchors to align with ACGME expectations of resident supervision 21 : Complete supervision: a faculty member is \"physically present with the resident and the patient\"; partial supervision: a supervising physician is \"physically within the hospital \u2026 immediately available\"; minimal supervision: the supervisor is \"not physically present \u2026 but is immediately available by means of telephonic and/ or electronic modalities.\" 21 Two final anchors are used similarly to how they are described in the Internal Medicine Milestones Project 15 : As if independent: the trainee \"is ready for unsupervised practice\" in the particular activity; and aspirational: the trainee is truly exceptional and \"reflect[s] the competence of an expert or role model.\" 15\n\n Step 2: Selecting subcompetencies for rotational EPAs After 8 to 10 representative EPAs are selected for a rotation or clinic, core faculty provide a description of the key behaviors related to each activity. The descriptions are edited to favor behaviors observable by faculty members (e.g., \"diagnose\" or \"manage,\" rather than \"understand\" or \"appreciate\"). These descriptions provide evaluators a shared frame of reference when assessing entrustment for each EPA.\n\n Core rotation faculty then review the 22 ACGME subcompetencies and identify those that are integral to the work of each EPA, based on the description they have written for that activity. In our program, most of these EPAs have been associated with 4 to 8 subcompetencies, although this number depends on the complexity of the EPA.\n\n The milestone elements that provide the narrative descriptions within each of the 22 subcompetencies serve as a catalog of discrete behaviors that link the EPA-based evaluations to the program ACGME milestone reports. Figure 3 illustrates how the milestone elements from the 4 to 8 connected subcompetencies can be mapped to the different evaluation response categories for a given EPA. Within a subcompetency, milestone elements from columns to the right naturally align with greater degrees of entrustment compared with milestone elements from columns to the left. Only those milestone elements relevant to a given EPA are mapped to the levels of entrustment for that activity. For example, milestone elements that reference the intensive care unit or outpatient clinic for subcompetency PC3 (Figure 2 ) would not be mapped to the evaluation item for an EPA from a general medicine ward experience.\n\n Linking evaluation responses at the level of the individual milestone elements, rather than at the level of each column within a subcompetency, allows programs to determine mapping according their culture, values, and expectations. For example, our program expects that for PC3 (Skill in Performing Procedures), each trainee \"maximizes patient comfort and safety when performing procedures\" not only at the \"aspirational\" level (where it was written by the Internal Medicine Milestone Project) 15 ; rather, we prioritize this behavior for all resident procedures and expect this at each level of entrustment above \"complete supervision.\"\n\n Using EPA-based evaluations to track progress among milestone elements\n\n In this system, attending physicians do not directly view the mapping of milestone elements to these evaluation responses; they are asked instead to focus on providing residents formative feedback about the rotational EPAs. Once the individual responses for each evaluation item have been mapped to a list of milestone elements from several subcompetencies, these relationships can be integrated into a residency management evaluation system or other computerized database. As refinements are made, mapping can be edited and adjusted by the training program without requiring that new evaluations be completed by faculty members.\n\n When a faculty member completes an evaluation and selects a degree of trustworthiness for a specific rotational EPA, the milestone elements mapped to that answer are marked as \"confirmed.\" For example, when a supervising physician attests that a resident can coordinate a patient discharge with \"minimal supervision,\" this would confirm multiple milestone elements (Figure 3) , including \"recognizes the importance of communication during times of transition\" (from the subcompetency Systems-Based Practice 4) and \"incorporates patientspecific preferences into plan of care\" (from the subcompetency Interpersonal Figure 3 Example rotational EPA mapping to subcompetencies and milestone elements.

Although their involvement in the aging process was postulated by Shay and Wright (Hayflick limit) [30] , the absence of specific markers of senescence has hampered efforts to characterize senescent cells that accumulate in vivo in tissues and organs. Nowadays, the process of cell senescence is becoming better known due to the availability of new techniques to determine and quantify the senescent characteristics. In general, the main characteristic of the senescent phenotype is that cells decline in DNA replication until they cease to proliferate associated with the molecular changes of elements related to the cell cycle [31] . In general, senescent cells exhibit an upregulation and secretion of growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and also they release extracellular matrix-degrading proteins, the overall contribution constitutes the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP) [32] and cells lose the ability to divide at the end of replicative lifespan and decrease their ability to migrate [33] . At a phenotypic level, senescent cells acquire the typical flattened and enlarged morphology [34] (Figure 1) . Aforementioned cells undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, including profound chromatin and secretome changes, telomere shortening, genomic and epigenomic damage, unbalanced mitogenic signals and tumor-suppressor activation [28, 29] . Also, in human replicative senescence, telomere lengths decline with each cell cycle [35] . Most of these cells are resistant to some apoptosis signals, therefore, they become senescent [31] . Senescence and apoptosis are responses to cellular stress, and both are important in the activation of tumor suppressors [36] , but senescence avoids the damage in the stressed cells. To date, some senescence markers have been described ( Table 1 ) that are involved in cellular senescence, most of which participate in cell cycle control and DNA repair [31] . Further analysis has highlighted that many common cellular markers of senescence (upregulation of senescence-associated (SA)-\u03b2-galactosidase (gal) and p16) [29] are not robust and might overestimate the numbers of senescent cells that are present at low frequencies [37] . Thus, other cellular markers, such as cyclin D1 and lamin B1 [38, 39] , are considered more reliable markers of senescence.\n\n The use of all these elements to define senescent cells has provided convincing evidence that these senescent cells accumulate in tissues of humans, primates and rodents with advanced age, as well as in sites of tissue injury and remodeling. The most prominent feature of the senescent cells is a cell cycle arrest, which permanently withholds replication and the resistance to apoptosis. An important fact to note is that the cells with senescent characteristics are found in damaged tissues of patients with chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or CKD [40] .\n\n CKD is known to promote cellular senescence and an accelerated aging. It is caused by the accumulation of toxins in the internal medium, and the consequence is the development of elderly associated pathologies, mainly CVD [48] . CKD-associated CVD show similar characteristics to the natural CVD in elderly, and for this reason, several authors propose that the biggest challenge in the treatment of CVD may be to understand why CKD promote the premature aging of the cardiovascular system [49] .\n\n Even though the progress in the last few years in the renal replacement therapy is substantial, the mortality of terminal CKD patients remains excessively high, with an incidence between 10 and 20-fold over the general population [50] .\n\n Uremic patients have higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than would be predicted by Framingham risk factors [50] [51] [52] . However, the presence of those factors is not enough to explain the significant increment of the cardiovascular risk in those patients. CKD patients show additional factors associated with uremia that could explain this increased CVD risk [53] . The presence of microalbumin and uremic toxins in blood, hyperhomocysteinemia, anemia, the abnormal calcium/phosphate metabolism, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level alterations, the treatment with vitamin D derived substances, the volume overload, the electrolytic imbalance, oxidative stress, inflammation, malnutrition, thrombogenic factors and the imbalance of NO/endothelin are risk factors intrinsically associated to CKD [54] .", "qa": [["1_59406965_1_1", "What are the main characteristics of senescent cells and how do they contribute to age-related disorders?", "Senescent cells exhibit a decline in DNA replication and lose the ability to proliferate.

Since thirty-three per cent of the European troops and twelve per cent of the local corps were regularly on the sick list, the hospitals were persistently overcrowded and undermanned. Nursing, therefore, was entrusted to invalid soldiers and those considered \"the scum of the regiments\". As the quality of nursing is vital in yellow fever-there is no other treatment as suchthe situation must be accounted extremely deleterious.\n\n Since yellow fever has no specific remedy, it is ironic that the French and British clashed so violently as to the appropriate method of treatment. The army was being sacrificed, so the colonists claimed, to the ignorance of the British doctors. Some French physicians denounced them in the English press and formally complained to the Army Medical Board. Both sides claimed to have had more success than the other, but it is significant that the troops themselves favoured French methods and lost confidence in their own doctors.88 Indeed, Hector McLean had to agree that it was absurd to send out to the West Indies doctors with no experience of tropical medicine. Somewhat misguidedly, he attacked the \"vanity\" and \"impudence\" of his French colleagues, who \"equally oeconomic of medicines and the truth ... committed their patients to a nurse and left the issue to nature\", which was really the best course of action. However, he came to recognize the importance of nursing and agreed that patients needed a special diet in place of the salt meat they continued to receive in hospital. He also adopted from the French their copious use of tisanes and lemonade, important in combating dehydration caused by continual vomiting, and their habit of warm baths, \"to cleanse the skin of impurities\".89\n\n British methods were by contrast violent. In the language of the day, they were \"inflammatory\", designed to excite the pulse and produce perspiration or salivation.\n\n 85 Letters \n\n Yellow fever in the 1790s TIhe \"anti-phlogistic regime\" practised by the French had gone out of fashion in the British islands about thirty years before. Since then, great stress had been laid on drugs (mercury, camphor, arsenic, laudanum, calomel), and on \"cordials\" (cinnamon water and cinchona bark infusions), as well as on wine. Purgatives, including the infamous James's Powder, had pride of place. British remedies were not always bad. Where malaria was concerned, the French were, of course, wrong to reject the use of quinine but, as McLean realized, it had no effect in cases of yellow fever. Calomel, then one of the latest fads in West Indian medicine, has been recommended as late as the 1960sl* in treating both malaria and yellow fever, but in the latter disease, where the stomach lining is attacked, aperients are positively harmful. McLean came to appreciate the deleterious effects of medicines that irritated the stomach but, nonetheless, came up with a fiendish stimulant of his own-cayenne pepper wrapped in balls of dough! Yet, he was no quack. Adventurous and eclectic, both he and Jackson represent a new empiricist approach to medicine that heralded the advances of the nineteenth century. One is impressed with his honesty and humility when grappling with forces that he confessed were beyond his comprehension. Neither man was afraid to say he had been wrong, and Jackson's acuteness of observation demands respect. It is unfortunate that their contributions to the treatment of yellow fever involved as many steps backwards as forwards. Equally critical of the medical establishment and of established medical theory and practice, both men stressed the need for \"bold measures\" and sought to cure by causing in their patients \"a complete change of system\".9' These were revolutionary times. Both became convinced that dousings with cold water were of the greatest benefit ... if employed early enough-the usual escape clause. Jackson later wrote a treatise on the subject.92 The method was unorthodox but not original. Although explicitly borrowed from the Indians of Asia and North America, it had long been known in British folk and orthodox medicine.93 Cold sponge baths clearly brought patients relief, but the scenes described of buckets of cold water being poured from great height on to feverish and unsuspecting victims partake of both tragedy and farce.

[In Thai], 2012 ) . High HIV incidence rates among MSM have also been reported in Bangkok; among 8,176 MSM seeking HIV testing at the Silom Community Clinic 2006-2013, HIV incidence was 5.5 per 100 person-years and among 1,744 MSM enrolled in a cohort study at the clinic, incidence was 5.3 per 100 person-years (van Griensven et al., 2015) . Epidemic modeling based on these studies and other data suggests that 43% of new HIV infections in Thailand in 2015 occurred among MSM (Thailand National Operational Plan Accelerating Ending AIDS 2015-2019. Thailand National AIDS Committee, 2014). Despite high HIV prevalence and incidence among MSM, the uptake of HIV testing is low; only half of 1,575 MSM surveyed in 2005 in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Phuket said they had had an HIV test (Wimonsate et al., 2011) and only one-fourth of those tested had returned to receive their HIV test result. In 2012, an analysis of data collected by the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) showed that only 7% of MSM in Thailand who received a package of HIV educational and prevention services opted for an HIV test (Wolf, 2012) . Similarly, a 2014 integrated biomedical and behavioral survey (IBBS) among MSM in Thailand found that only one-third of MSM had been tested for HIV and knew their result (Supiya Jantaramanee, 2014) . These data suggest that many HIVinfected MSM have missed opportunities to be diagnosed and receive treatment, and, unaware of their HIV status, may transmit HIV to their sexual partners.\n\n HIV testing is the entry point to access Test and Treat services and PrEP, and increasing HIV testing among people at high risk of infection is an important goal of Thailand's National Operational Plan for Ending AIDS 2015-2019 (Thailand National Operational Plan Accelerating Ending AIDS 2015-2019.

Started in late 2011, the HIV prevention program for MSM (PREV) aimed to increase HIV testing, ensure that people tested received their results, and that those who tested HIV-positive were linked to care. This was done using a combination of peer-led counseling and referrals to facilities that had received sensitivity training and non-facility-based HTS.

This effect is maintained during LBW babies' early childhoods. Whereas LBW infants utilize the services of resident doctors more often, VLBW babies mainly receive inpatient services throughout their early lives. The disaggregated analysis shows that the parents of LBW infants consult GPs more often in the first year of their infants' lives, whereas the significant effect among the 2-5-year age group is mainly driven by expenditures at disabled centers and on pediatric services. The significant impact of birth weight on the utilization of disabled centers may indicate that children born at LBW are at a higher risk of suffering from severe physical or psychic impairments.

Patients with type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin replacement therapy administered via daily injections or insulin pump. Not only is this inconvenient, but intensive exogenous insulin therapy could lead to complications from hypoglycemia unawareness. A promising approach for more permanent and long-term insulin replacement is islet transplantation (50, 53) . However, this approach has numerous limitations, such as the need for millions of donor islets, need for initial invasive surgery and prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, poor graft survival, and lack of suitable techniques to monitor transplant development in vivo. Such problems greatly limit the long-term success rate of islet transplantation (3, 6 -8, 14, 50, 53) . The ideal transplantation strategy for type 1 diabetes should include minimally invasive placement of transplants, no need for immunosuppression, long-term reversal of diabetes, and the possibility for noninvasive in vivo monitoring of transplants. We report considerable success in achieving these goals in diabetic mouse models through subcutaneous transplantation of GFP-expressing embryonic pancreatic tissue into recipient mice with type 1 diabetes followed by noninvasive graft monitoring with two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM).\n\n Even though the techniques for intrahepatic embolization of islets through portal vein are being progressively refined, life-threatening complications, such as portal hemorrhage, portal hypertension, and thrombosis, can still occur (3, 6, 9, 50) . The subcutaneous space is a superficial and easily accessible site where transplants can be performed in a minimally invasive manner with no risk and little stress to recipients. In addition to eliminating risks associated with portal vein cannulation, the subcutaneous site has the added advantage of extensive surface area and the option for repeated transplants if necessary. However, this site is limited by poor vascularaization potential, resulting in low success rates in previous attempts at islet transplantation (19, 28, 54, 63) . Although different techniques are being developed to improve graft vascularization in the subcutaneous space, these require complex manipulations and/or multiple surgeries for the same transplant (10, 29, 42, 59, 63) . Transplantation of embryonic tissue as opposed to mature islets is a simpler solution for maintaining graft survival and vascularization in the subcutaneous space. Being a built-in source of angiogenic factors, embryonic tissue may achieve better vascularization than mature islets (44 -46) . It is possible that embryonic tissue may also resist rejection due to its immune-privileged nature (16 -18, 26, 31, 34, 41) , although the immunogenicity of embryonic pancreatic tissue has not yet been demonstrated. Embryonic pancreas from mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the regulation of insulin 1 promoter (MIP-GFP mice) emit easily detectable bright fluorescence from their \u2424-cells after embryonic day E13.5 (20, 21) , providing an excellent model for in vivo graft monitoring through the intact skin.\n\n The current study demonstrates successful endocrine differentiation, vacularization, and significant improvement of blood glucose homeostasis following subcutaneous transplantation of embryonic pancreata into immune-deficient diabetic mice. In addition to normalization of glucose tolerance, subcutaneous transplants also enabled diabetic mice to gain back the lost adipose tissue and enhanced overall well-being. Considering that these outcomes occurred without specialized maneuvers, it is predictable that better graft survival rates in non-immunedeficient animals may be achieved through simple facilitation techniques such as addition of exogenous growth factors or anti-inflammatory agents. Thus, the current results demonstrate a successful first step toward correction of type 1 diabetes through noninvasive transplantation, which can be refined and customized for human patients through appropriate modifications such as the use of stem cell-derived islet tissue.\n\n \n\n Donor embryonic pancreata were obtained from MIP-GFP mice, originally donated by Dr. Graeme Bell at the University of Chicago and now maintained in our colony (20, 21) . Recipients were immunedeficient NCRNU-M-M nude mice (Taconic) (60), and NOD-SC-M-M mice (Taconic) (61) rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (125 mg/kg ip, repeated every 2 wk as necessary until diabetes induced).
