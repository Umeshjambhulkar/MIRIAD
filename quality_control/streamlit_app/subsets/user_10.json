Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

Lung ischaemia and the ensuing reperfusion can precipitate LIRI, which is a leading cause of operative morbidity and mortality. A large number of possible treatments have been investigated to prevent or reduce LIRI, one of which is IP. Although the comprehensive mechanism remains unclear, IP seems to increase the tolerance of organs to subsequent sustained ischaemia. IP has been shown to be effective clinically in hepatic resection and in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but its role remains unproved in clinical LIRI [2] . A more thorough understanding of the factors contributing to IP and how it may be facilitated to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with LIRI. In this experimental model of LIRI, haemodynamic, gasometric and biochemical parameters were studied in the early stages of lung IR. An inflammatory response manifested by an increase in oxidative stress, leukocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokines in lung tissue was observed. IP prevented many of these IR-induced effects. The haemodynamic and gasometric measurements remained relatively constant throughout the experiment, both in the control and experimental groups. Transient increase in PPn MPAP could have been related to previous IP manoeuvre. Interestingly, reperfused lungs showed a better ability to oxygenate the circulating blood when IP was performed.\n\n Clinical and experimental studies have suggested that IR injury occurs in a biphasic pattern. It has been shown that alveolar macrophages, which are activated during ischaemia, play a crucial role in the early phase of reperfusion [5] , whereas neutrophils and lymphocytes have a more important role in the delayed phase, which occurs over the subsequent 24 h [5, 6, 18] . In addition, numerous studies have documented that IR increases ROS and that macrophages produce pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to oxidative stress [18] . Some of these cytokines released by macrophages before and after reperfusion will be involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the lung during reperfusion [19] . The findings of this study correlate well with the suggested biphasic pattern of IR injury.

With the clinical suspicion of deep neck infection, brain and neck computed tomography (CT) was performed. The neck CT revealed internal jugular venous distention with a thickened enhancing wall, filling defects in the lumen, and air bubbles. In the brain CT, there were aeration defects and effusion on mastoid cellules and the middle ear and filling defects and air bubbles in the right sigmoid and transvers sinuses ( Figure 1 ). In order to determine the extent and other accompanying complications, contrasted brain and neck MRI were performed, which revealed that there was signal void loss in T2WI on the right IJV (Figure 2 ), right sigmoid, and transverse sinus; internal jugular venous distention with a thickened enhancing wall and filling defects in the IJV and sigmoid-transverse sinus lumens (Figures 3 and 4) .

Unfortunately, philosophy does not offer a ready-made, one-size-fits-all theory of causation that can be straightforwardly imported into medical practice. The debate over how to best conceptualize causation is still much debated among philosophers. In addition, we should not be too hasty in assuming that there is a single theory that can be applied across the sciences. Perhaps an account of causation that works fine in economics will not shed light on physics, and some insights might shed light on internal medicine but not on neuroscience. However, there is a whole host of philosophical tools at our disposal, which can help tailor a concept of causation that is appropriate for the future of individualized medicine. The classic empiricist approach based on regularities provides an inadequate metaphysical foundation for modern medicine, which aims at profiling exact, sometimes unique, interventions at the level of individual patients. Furthermore, as discussed, there is a growing awareness that classic RCTs face significant limitations in causal epistemology and in producing the de-tailed knowledge required to address health problems at the individual level.\n\n Fifteen years after having completed the decoding of the human genome, we are now witnessing an unprecedented progress in both biology and medicine (Green and Guyer, 2011) . Genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and various other 'omics' fields realize the vision and dream of previous generations of physicians. New discoveries generate unique opportunities for understanding health and disease and for enhancing the treatment of human illnesses. Over the past decade, there has been an exponential acceleration in the invention of new diagnostic and therapeutic options. These innovations are on the verge of revolutionizing the way we approach the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases (Cooms, 2012) . Indeed, the technology for allowing rapid and precise identification of viruses and bacteria and their sensitivities to chemotherapeutic interventions at point-of-care level already exists. Treatments could be started early, preventing the exposure of patients to broad-spectrum antibiotics and eventually curbing todays disconcerting rates of antibiotic resistance. Precision medicine is already a reality in oncology. In lung neoplasia, there are novel classifications founded on molecular testing, anatomic criteria and histologic criteria. Genetic markers guide the prescription of highly effective treatments (Kwak and Camidge, 2010) . The integration of genetics with advanced computing and imaging techniques, and breakthrough approaches-such as epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics-has already expanded the potential of precision medicine, generating new classifications of human disease with improved prognostic and therapeutic implications. To illustrate, the precise molecular diagnosis of multiple endocrine type-2 neoplasia may now be adopted as a decisional basis for prophylactic thyroidectomy and a screening tool for medullary thyroid cancer, hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma in patients harbouring this disease (Moore and Dluhy, 2005) . To focus on nephrological examples, kidney biopsy is presently held as the state-of-the-art test for diagnosing acute rejection. It is likely that in the medium term, the biopsy will be replaced by a safer, non-invasive approach based on the study of urinary cells. Indeed, a signature of just three genes robustly discriminates biopsy specimens showing acute cellular rejection from rejection-free specimens (Suthanthiran et al., 2013) .\n\n We are at the dawn of a new era. Theoretical and techno-logical advancements are producing the knowledge we need to found and develop the biomedical science of the 21 st century. Precision medicine is now a foreseeable objective for medical practice, giving us the unprecedented possibility to assess causality directly in single cases and to design treatment at the individual level (Collins and Varmus, 2015; Jameson and Longo, 2015 ). This precise knowledge will allow for the adoption of simple, immediate trials to test the efficacy of treatments at the individual level and may eventually replace proof of efficacy at the group level, the current pursuit of large-scale RCTs. In order for the great promise of the 'omics' sciences to become deployable and affordable in the world of clinical medicine, shifting from populations and probabilities to individuals and exactness, our current empiricist means of assessing causality in medicine will have to be revised to obtain a more solid philosophical foundation for evidence-based practice.", "qa": [["30_2358498_3_1", "How can the advancements in genomics and other 'omics' fields contribute to precision medicine?\n", "The advancements in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics' fields have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine.

Using the C-regional oriented tracer (Inolex), C III is most sensitive for the 44-68 peptide. However, with the intact tracer (Wilson), the assay becomes sensitive for the N-terminal peptide -34. Whether this change of specificity is related to confqrmational changes of the peptide induced by plasma pro t ein, or is a result of decreased adsorption of the peptide to the surface of the incubation tubes (15) is unclear. This observation makes it likely that antiserum CIII contains two distinctly different anti-parathyrinimmunoglobulins; one being anti-mid-regional (protein independent) the other being anti-N*terminal (protein dependent) with a relatively Ipw titer. This wouM explain the decrease in maximal specific binding when performed in buffer. Most of the C III antkparathyrinimmunoglobulin reacts preferentially with protions of the Inolex tracer (C-regional); therefore a high maximal binding is obtained at a final antibody dilution of 1/8700. In contrast, when the assay was performed with the Wilson tracer, B 0 decreased at a final antibody dilution of 1/5200, thus illustrating a protein-dependent binding to the N-terminal antibody portions. Additional experiments using a tyrosinated 1-34 (34-Tyr) human parathyrin tracer (unpublished data) showed a maximal specifie binding of 0.264 at a final dilution of 1/1750. These observations make it very likely that antiserum CIII consists of at least two antibody idiotypes. Antibody G III remained specific for the C-regional parathyrin independent of the tracer, which makes it very useful for clinical studies. However, slight changes in sensitivity due to the tracer were observed. Our data illustrates that the assay specificity is also related to the protein content in the incubation mixture. Using the Wilson tracer, the characteristics of antiserum C III were influenced by plasma addition. Specific maximal binding increased more than twofold, while the non-specific binding remained nearly unchanged. Thi \u00a7 implies that plasma fractions facilitate the binding of the N-regional oriented tracer to the antibody. The mechanism of this reaction, however, is unknown but seems to be restricted to N-terminal oriented or intact tracers. In contrast, the C-regional specific tracer exhibited no vulnerability to changes in plasma content, which has also been reported by other investigators (16) . However, plasma seems not only to facilitate the binding of the N-terminal tracer to the antibody, but also that of N-terminal peptides, since the 1-34 peptide revealed a higher ability to displace the Wilson tracer. Whether these changes in affinity, for either the tracer or the Standard, are related to changes in reactivity of the immunoglobulins, or to conformational effects on the tracer hormones is unknown. Changes in the conformation may be responsible for the inabi\u00fcty of the iodinated sequence 42-55 (42-Tyr) of human parathyrin to bind to both antibodies. This was astonishing \u00e4s this peptide covers most of the 44-68 human parathyrin sequence. The 28-48 bovine parathyrin and the 53-84 human parathyrin (both including parts of the 44-68 sequence) are almost unable to displace either of the tracer preparations. Therefore, distinct conformational requirements for peptide-antibody interactions are to be expected. Similar observations have already been described for the 1-12 fragment of human parathyrin (17) , thus confirming this explanation. No explanation can yet be offered for the increased npn-specific binding of the Wilson tracer. However, the tr\u00e4cer binding to plasma components should be considered (18) . This also would imply that only N-terminal parts of the parathyrin molecule have a high affinity for plasma fractions, while mid-and C-regional fragments are only weakly attached to proteins (16) .\n\n Our findings demonstrate that antibody G III is very useful for the determination of C-and mid-regional parathyrin Fragments containing the sequence 44-68, independent of the tracer preparation and the protein content of the assay System. Antibody C III is an interesting antiserum, which could be used under welldefined incubation conditions for the detection of N-terminal and intact parathyrin. Parathyrin from tissue culture is shown to be extremly useful for routine parathyrin radioimmunoassays and might provide better interlaboratpry comparison than pqoled hyperparathyroid sera, since this hormone preparation can be produced in large quantities.

Consistent with previous studies of naturally occurring exacerbations increases in symptoms and reduction in lung function persisted for between 2 and 4 weeks from virus inoculation [28] .\n\n The changes in PEF (~12%) seen in this study were of similar magnitude to that reported elsewhere [29] . The colds were accompanied by evidence of viral replication and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in the upper respiratory tract, although the increase in IL-6 levels just failed to reach significance. As the aim of this study was primarily to ascertain the feasibility and safety of RV16 inoculation in COPD we did not carry out lower airway sampling but the results from this study suggest that further studies to evaluate the effect of rhinovirus infection on lower airway inflammation are warranted. Although epidemiological studies have shown an association between virus infection and COPD exacerbation they do not prove causation. This study provides further supportive evidence in addition to epidemiological studies that respiratory virus infection can cause COPD exacerbations. Given that there is data suggesting virus-induced exacerbations are more severe [5] , development of effective antiviral strategies is an urgent priority.\n\n The timing of upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract symptoms observed in this study may have important implications for diagnostic epidemiology of virus induced COPD exacerbations [5, 6] . The virus load in nasal lavage was greatest on day 4, whereas the peak lower respiratory tract symptoms occurred on days 10/11. Assessing the relationship between virus infection and COPD exacerbations depends on sampling for viruses when patients report lower respiratory tract symptoms. Sampling the upper respiratory tract for viruses when patients present with lower respiratory tract symptoms may give a falsely low detection rate, as sampling will likely occur well after the peak of virus load has passed in the upper respiratory tract. This interpretation is supported by our data as only 2/4 (50%) of the subjects had positive nasal lavage PCR for rhinoviruses on day 11. Further evidence to support this comes from the East London COPD study in which 64% of exacerbations were preceded by colds but a virus was detected in only 39% [5] , so the true association of respiratory virus infection and COPD exacerbations is likely even higher than reported. This may also have important implications for therapy of virus-induced COPD exacerbations. The cold symptoms peaked on day 7, but were clearly elevated as early as day 4, co-incident with the peak in virus load, whereas lower respiratory symptoms peaked on days 10 & 11, suggesting that if an effective antiviral or anti-inflammatory agent were administered at the onset of Daily and clinic spirometry measurements cold symptoms, there is a window of several days for treatment to exert a beneficial effect. There is already data suggesting that early treatment of exacerbations leads to better outcomes [30] and this data should encourage efforts to develop new treatments for exacerbations of COPD.\n\n An unexpected finding of this study was that all subjects developed colds and exacerbations with 10-to 1,000-fold lower doses of virus than used in previous studies in asthmatic and normal volunteers [9, 15] . This could suggest that COPD patients have increased susceptibility to virus infection, as has recently been demonstrated in asthma [31, 32] . Further studies will be needed to investigate this interesting and potentially very important possibility.\n\n We acknowledge that the conclusions of this study are derived from results on only 4 subjects, however as the pre-determined criteria for termination of the study were reached (infection and exacerbation in 80% of 5 subjects), we were obliged to terminate the study. We chose this study design as previous dose-finding studies in experimental virus infections have used similar patient numbers [33, 34] . The data from this study suggests that experimental rhinovirus infection can be used to develop a valid and safe model of COPD exacerbation. Such a model could overcome the many obstacles that investigators face in studying naturally occurring exacerbations including under-reporting of exacerbations [5] , delay in presentation [30] , varying aetiology, difficulties in sampling the lower airway and variation in timing from onset of exacerbation to clinical assessment and sampling. These difficulties can all be overcome in the experimental setting, leading to high quality, well controlled data that is likely to take us significant steps forward in the search for novel therapies.\n\n We have shown that experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients results in colds that are accompanied by lower respiratory tract symptoms and lung function changes typical of naturally occurring exacerbations. These were associated with evidence of viral replication and inflammatory cytokines in the upper airway. These findings suggest experimental rhinovirus infection has potential as a model of COPD exacerbation.", "qa": [["62_15010825_4_1", "What are the potential implications of the timing of upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract symptoms in virus-induced COPD exacerbations?\n", "The timing of upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract symptoms in virus-induced COPD exacerbations may have important implications for diagnostic epidemiology.

Although identification of infants with SCID was the intended aim of TREC-based newborn screening programs, it became evident that in addition to this disorder, the assay would also identify infants with T cell lymphopenia due to other primary and secondary causes (Table 3) . For example, low TREC levels have been detected in individuals with 22q deletion syndrome, CHARGE association, and Trisomy 21 [26] . In addition, infants with forms of PID other than SCID may have low TREC, for example in ataxia telangiectasia and combined immunodeficiency diseases (CID). Thus far in prospective pilot studies, many cases of CID without an identifiable molecular cause have been detected using the TREC assay [27, 28, 30] and these patients require clinical characterization and long-term follow-up.\n\n In addition to TREC analysis, other SCID screening approaches have been proposed. In Italy, newborns are screened for SCID with the TREC assay, along with tandem mass spectrometry to identify ADA deficiency, which also enables identification of infants with delayed-onset ADA deficiency [31] [32] [33] . A similar approach has been described to identify patients with PNP deficiency [34] . A two-tiered testing approach using TREC analysis combined with IL-7 measurement has also been proposed as a means to increase the specificity of SCID screening [35] ; however, this has not yet been optimized for application in large-scale screening programs [36] .\n\n Primary immunodeficiency diseases were previously thought to be rare entities, and the incidence of SCID was unknown. Prospective screening programs have since enabled the true incidence of SCID to be determined. Furthermore, screening has facilitated the identification and treatment of infants who would have otherwise died from complications of undiagnosed SCID. Based on studies in the USA where over 3 million infants were screened, the incidence of SCID was found to be much higher than expected at 1/58000 and the incidence of clinically relevant T cell lymphopenia was 1/7300 [27] . The annual live birth rate in the USA is approximately 4 million. Given that it was previously estimated that the incidence of SCID was 1/100000, screening has thereby increased the number of expected cases from approximately [29] 40 to 69 annually, equating to an additional 29 cases each year identified and managed with potentially curative treatment.\n\n Given that PID constitute a large and heterogeneous group of genetic disorders which are individually rare entities, newborn screening offers additional benefits beyond individual patient care. Screening provides important opportunities to increase our knowledge of the clinical and pathophysiological spectrum of PID and gain additional experience in management of these conditions, particularly as affected infants are identified early in their disease course. Newborn screening thereby facilitates continued, collaborative research and progression of our knowledge in this field by enabling collation of rare and diverse cases and building national and international expertise.\n\n Mutations in key genes which are essential for B cell ontogeny give rise to congenital B cell deficiency disorders including Xlinked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (resulting from a mutation in the BTK gene) and autosomal recessive XLA-like disorders. Patients have absent B cells, extremely low or undetectable immunoglobulin levels, and an increased susceptibility to severe infection with bacteria and other pathogens [16] . Like T cells, B cells also undergo rearrangement of the variable, diversity, and joining domains (V(D)J recombination) during development in order to produce unique B cell antigen receptors, and this process also yields episomal, circular DNA referred to as a kappa recombining excision circles (KREC). V(D)J recombination within the IGK locus results in a Vk-Jk coding joint, followed by rearrangement of the intron RSS and Kde elements with deletion of the Ck exon and enhancers. The coding joint remains present in the genome, whereas the KREC with the corresponding signal joint is excluded as a stable, circularized DNA fragment [37] . In 2007, van Zelm et al. described this process and developed a KREC assay using a PCR-based method [37] . They demonstrated that KREC levels reflected the replication history of B cells and had potential utility in assessing B cell recovery following HSCT and in the assessment of patients with antibody deficiency disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [37] .

I want to thank God for my family because they support me so much. (OT, female, ART patient)\n\n Extended family also played a support role, often by sending food and money to PLWHA. This was particularly the case when PLWHA had relatives working in the cities.\n\n In conditions of poverty, a key contributing factor to ART adherence is community support. One patient highlighted how people in his village have organized themselves so that they all support each other.\n\n The best thing about my village is the way we are living. When it comes to ploughing, people share knowledge so that they can plant for themselves and sell to each other. People are encouraging each other to take their children to school.

(KA, male, ART patient)\n\n Relationships with healthcare providers The development of positive long-term relationships between healthcare workers and patients was cited by participants as central to achieving optimal adherence. Patients and care givers attended several sessions with both HIV nurses and HIV counsellors before being initiated on ART and after initiation, at regular periods throughout treatment. In the following quotation, a nurse emphasizes the importance of developing strong nurse -patient relationships:\n\n That relationship or that openness between the nurse and the patient can encourage a patient to adhere to drugs. Then health education between the patient or the family member or the caregiver and the nurse can encourage adherence of the patient. (MS, female, nurse) Developing trust and mutual respect between healthcare workers and patients encouraged patients to continue coming to the clinic and to openly discuss confusion, adherence problems and concerns. Patients spoke frequently of the importance of networks of support available through the clinic. In the following, TC, an ART patient, drew on her relationship with the counsellor at the clinic for emotional support and a referral to a home based care group:\n\n In fact for me it was really hard, very hard indeed, especially when I first discovered that I was HIV positive. I got so stressed . . . So I decided to go back to the hospital and discussed my issues with the counselor who was there. She talked to me at length and also referred me to the home-based care team who talked to me and try to make me understand that it was not the end of my life. (TC, female, ART patient) Patients valued the dedication of healthcare staff and often described them as a key source of support.\n\n Social participation offers people on ART and their carers access to vital forms of support to overcome obstacles to adherence. Externally implemented programmes, such as the roll out of ART across sub-Saharan Africa, can benefit from understanding and working with preexisting community support networks.\n\n HIV support groups were the most emphatically praised form of social participation by ART patients, with many suggesting that these groups offered them emotional support needed to gain hope, remain committed to treatment and challenge stigmatizing attitudes (Campbell et al., 2011) . NGO food and income generation support helped PLWHA overcome material barriers to optimal treatment as well as relational and symbolic barriers through restoring their capacity to contribute food or money to their households.\n\n Home-based care groups emerged during our research as remarkably dedicated and valued volunteer organizations. ART patients and healthcare staff frequently referred to HBC groups as acting as emotional and practical support. Church groups also supported people on ART, primarily through tending to the sick. The extensive work done by these two groups to encourage HIV testing and ongoing ART was deeply valued by PLWHA and their carers.\n\n Family networks were another resource available to people on ART with great potential to help them access and adhere to ART. Treatment partners, such as a spouse or (in the care of children) guardian, provided emotional support and encouragement as well as practical help. Family members reminded ART patients about appointments and when to take their pills, although we did also find that elderly guardians struggled in their role as treatment partner to HIV-positive children in their care (Skovdal, 2011b) . Families also helped ART patients access enough money for food, travel and hospital fees. Strong relationships between healthcare providers and patients enabled people on ART to access optimal ART. Counselling before and throughout treatment was cited as a very valuable form of support whereby PLWHA gained both information and a sense of camaraderie and hope.\n\n This paper illustrates that even in highly resource-constrained environments, a wide range of indigenous community resources are available to promote positive responses to HIV. These community resources facilitate the success of ART, an external intervention, through providing social, emotional, spiritual and material support for those on treatment and their families. Through these extensive indigenous networks of support PLWHA are able to overcome many of the barriers in order to access and adhere to ART.

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), calculated from two b values, is a quantitative analysis of diffusion that has received significant attention in clinical practice (2, 3) . However, the ADC calculated from a mono-exponential fit has been shown to be larger than the true diffusion in voxels, which means traditional DWI and ADC might have been overestimated for lesion analysis in daily practice.\n\n Le Bihan et al. (4) proposed the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model after proving that perfusion exists inherently in diffusion-weighted image voxels and influences the measurement of the ADC subtly. Both diffusion and perfusion can be quantified or estimated separately by multi-b values according to a bi-exponential model, including D, f, and D*, which represent the pure diffusion coefficient, perfusion fraction, and pseudodiffusion coefficient, respectively. Recently, IVIM has become popular and has been applied routinely in the human body, mostly to evaluate therapeutic response (5, 6) , in chronic disease assessment (7, 8) , and for lesion detection and characterization (9, 10) . One of the most conspicuous advantages of IVIM is that it does not require contrast medium injection. It is believed that the IVIM parameters between malignant and benign tumors of the liver are apparently different (11) (12) (13) (14) ; however, these previous reports were of limited use because they included non-solid tumors, such as cysts, abscesses, or hemangiomas; hypovascular metastatic lesions; and ill-defined tumors like cholangiocarcinoma, which are hard to delineate in the analysis.\n\n The aim of the present study was to determine whether IVIM-derived parameters are distinct between HCC and FNH and whether they can be used to differentiate these solid hyperenhancing tumors noninvasively.\n\n \n\n This study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the examination. Inclusion criterion was a suspected FNH or HCC without previous treatment. Between January 2016 and July 2016, we examined 41 patients with clinically suspected FNH (n=5) and HCC (n=36), as observed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) no liver nodule or tumor on CT or MRI; (b) lesion diameter <1 cm; and (c) accompanying portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in HCC.\n\n The final study population comprised 5 patients with FNH and 22 patients with HCC (excluding 14 patients with PVTT: 9 PVTTs in the right branch or its sub-branch, 1 in the left branch, and 4 in the trunk or its bifurcation). In HCC group, there were 21 patients with mild or severe cirrhosis and 1 without obvious cirrhosis. Also, in this group, 16 patients were Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, 1 patient was HBsAg negative, while 5 patients were not tested in our hospital. The mean age was 42.0\u00b19.2 years (range, 33-52 years) in the FNH group and 52.6\u00b113.7 years (range, 25-79 years) in the HCC group. Histopathologic confirmation was available in 11 patients with HCC (8 patients confirmed after surgery and 3 patients confirmed by biopsy) and in 2 patients with FNH (after surgery).

It is useful to decrease the incidence of delayed neuropsychologic sequelae in patients with CO-poisoning [1] [2] . Although patients with CO-poisoning could benefit from the therapy, the side effects, such as barotrauma, should not be overlooked. Barotrauma is defined as tissue damage resulting from the direct effects of pressure [3] [4] . According to Boyle's law, a primary change in environmental pressure results in an inverse change in volume. Pressure changes can affect the ears, the sinuses, and the lungs, resulting in injury. Otic barotrauma is one of the most common barotraumas after HBO therapy and is sometimes accompanied by sinus barotraumas [3] [4] . Under normal conditions, the eustachian tube must open to eliminate the pressure difference between the internal and ambient environments. When the eustachian tube or sinus ostia is blocked or the pressure change exceeds the capacity of its regulation, otic and sinus barotrauma occurs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .\n\n Otic barotrauma can cause many discomforts, such as tinnitus, hearing loss, pain and fullness in the sinus and middle ear, and even tympanic membrane perforation. Sinus barotrauma can cause headache, pain and fullness in the sinuses.The diagnosis is based on symptoms and otoscopy or rhinoscopy. The treatments depend on the symptoms and clinical examinations, such as temporary cessation of HBO therapy and the use of decongestants and antibiotics; occasionally, functional middle ear or sinus surgery is needed [2] [3] [4] . Patients with CO-poisoning and with reduced sensory and cognitive function may have no or slight symptoms of otic and sinus barotrauma after HBO therapy. This situation may lead to a misdiagnosis and/or delay in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, early diagnosis and differential diagnosis are important to relieve early symptoms and prevent disease progression.\n\n Owing to its high sensitivity to water and fluid on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and high sensitivity to hemorrhage on T2WI, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advantages for observing the abnormalities of the middle ear and paranasal sinuses, such as mucosal edema, fluid exudation and subperiosteal hemorrhage. Some studies have reported the MRI findings of temporal bone abnormalities [9] [10] [11] [12] . On MR images, air and bone are black, and it is easy to distinguish air or bone from mucosal edema or hemorrhage. MRI can also be used to investigate the abnormalities of sinuses. Mucosal thickening in paranasal sinuses exceeding 3 mm is considered abnormal [13] [14] [15] [16] . Segev et al [17] reported that frontal sinus barotrauma of a flight passenger showed hyperintensity on both T1WI and T2WI sequences, which was consistent with subacute submucosal hemorrhage. MRI is available to depict the early and subtle mucosal changes of the middle ear and paranasal sinuses, and it has the potential to observe otic and sinus barotrauma.\n\n To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the MRI abnormalities of otic and sinus barotrauma. We conducted this study to retrospectively investigate otic and sinus barotrauma by MRI. We hypothesized the following: (1) MRI can depict otic and sinus barotrauma, (2) MRI can differentiate otic and sinus barotrauma from acute otitis media and sinusitis, and (3) MRI can be used to follow the progress of otic and sinus barotrauma.\n\n \n\n The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College.

This suggests an indirect effect of the bacterial flora on the ADC of N, especially as the ADC corrected for bacterial content is similar in the three protein only-supplemented diets (MBM, GM and PM). The higher bacterial content in the GM \u00fe oligosaccharide group might have resulted in a higher faecal metabolic N loss due to the increased proliferation of the intestinal wall. Feeding fermentable fibres (beet pulp, pectin or gum arabica) to dogs increased colonic weight and mucosal surface:volume ratio compared with low-fermentable fibre (cellulose) (Reinhart et al. 1994) . Dogs fed pectin or gum arabica also showed mucus distension, exfoliation and/or cryptitis.\n\n Bacterial N increased in the protein-supplemented diets and was increased further by the addition of oligosaccharides as expected. Howard et al. (2000) also estimated bacterial N, but by measuring purine content and bacterial isolates (using the method of Zinn & Owens, 1986 ) in dogs after supplementation with different fibre sources. Bacterial N expressed as a percentage of faecal N output increased significantly by adding 1\u00b75 % of FOS to the diet. In the cellulose (6 %)-based diet, 22\u00b78 % of the faecal N was bacterial N compared with 34\u00b74 % after FOS supplementation. In the present study slightly higher percentages were found even in the control diets (27\u00b75 -33\u00b76 %). The bacterial N expressed as a percentage of N intake was also slightly higher in the present study (5\u00b72 -6\u00b74 % for the control diets and 7\u00b755 -8\u00b739 % for the oligosaccharide-supplemented diets) compared with the study of Howard et al.\n\n (2000) (2\u00b79 % in the cellulose diet, 4\u00b75 % in FOS). However, neither the analytical methods (both estimations of bacterial protein) nor the diets were equal in the two studies. In cats, similar bacterial protein concentrations (Mason (1969) method) were found (25 % of faecal protein in control to 35\u00b72 % with 6 % inulin) (Hesta et al. 2001) . The faecal bacterial N content in the control groups increased from C MB to C PM . It is possible that the washout period was not long enough for a complete return to regular situations. Bacterial N content (% DM) was highest in the GM \u00fe oligosaccharides group compared with the other supplemented groups. When bacterial N was expressed as a percentage of faecal N, the GM \u00fe oligosaccharides group value became the lowest suggesting the bacterial N was diluted in a higher amount of undigested feed N as a consequence of the slightly higher protein intake from the GM diet.\n\n There was no decrease in faecal pH after supplementation with oligosaccharides. A decreased faecal pH was supposed because of the production of short-chain fatty acids and other organic acids (lactic acids) during fermentation. A decreased faecal pH and increased concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was seen after supplementation of oligofructose or inulin to a protein-balanced diet in cats but only when higher concentrations were used and not with a 3 % supplementation (Hesta et al. 2001) . Possibly, an increased saccharolytic activity is not maintained throughout the large intestine due to the exhaustion of the lower doses of prebiotics. Houdijk (1998) also suggested that the non-digestible oligosaccharides-induced increase of saccharolytic activity was not maintained throughout the hindgut in pigs. However the decrease in pH could also be masked by the higher ammonia production in the protein-enriched diets. Indeed there was a higher pH for the three enriched diets in comparison with the basal diet, undoubtedly due to the higher ammonia concentration (% DM) in these diets. Increased colonic luminal ammonia concentrations can promote tumorigenesis by stimulating cell proliferation (Lupton & Marchant, 1989) . However a lower faecal ammonia concentration after oligosaccharide supplementation was not seen in the present study. A study in rats (Lupton & Marchant, 1989) showed decreased ammonia concentrations in the caecum but three times greater concentrations in the colon after supplementing a low-(8 %) as well as a highprotein (24 %) diet with pectin (8 %).", "qa": [["82_25759603_6_1", "How do fermentable fibers affect the colonic weight and mucosal surface in dogs?\n", "Feeding fermentable fibers such as beet pulp, pectin, or gum arabica to dogs increased colonic weight and mucosal surface:volume ratio compared to low-fermentable fiber diets.

While much of the development and widespread implementation of these systems was previously supported by public health preparedness funding, the reduction of these monies has greatly constrained the ability of public health agencies to staff and maintain these systems. The appearance of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H3N2v, and other novel influenza A viruses required agencies to carefully identify systems which provide the most cost-effective data to support their public health practice. The global emergence of influenza A (H7N9), Ebola virus strains, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other viruses associated with high mortality, emphasize the importance of maintaining vigilance for the presence of emerging diseases.\n\n This project included a review of data obtained from a survey of public health practitioners recruited among members of the International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS) Public Health Practice Committee (PHPC) during 2012 and 2013 (1, 2) . In these surveys, questions were selected for discussion and additional responses collected from influenza surveillance coordinators using a web-based survey tool managed by ISDS staff on behalf of the PHPC. During 2014 and 2015, additional information was requested to assess efforts to identify highly-pathogenic avian and other novel influenza strains, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viruses (3).

This latest survey revealed that most jurisdictions continue to be challenged to be able to maintain the variety of surveillance systems needed for conducting emerging disease surveillance. A major challenge continues to be the recruitment and retention of well-trained and experienced public health and informatics staff to maintain these systems in an era of increasingly limited resources. Many public health practitioners are tasked with establishing new surveillance protocols for an increasing number of diseases associated with novel and emerging viruses including HPAI, influenza A (H3N2)v infections associated with agricultural fairs and ruling out influenza A (H7N9), MERS-CoV, and even Ebola virus infections. Most jurisdictions continually struggle to determine which surveillance systems are the most cost-effective for providing the most valuable data in the face of decreasing funding.\n\n Public health agencies continue to strive to develop and maintain cost-effective disease surveillance systems to better understand the burden of disease within their jurisdictions. The emergence of novel influenza, other respiratory viruses and other emerging diseases offer new challenges to public health practitioners. The importance of maintaining sufficient infrastructure and the trained personnel needed to operate surveillance systems for optimal disease detection and public health response readiness cannot be understated.
