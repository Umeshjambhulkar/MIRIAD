Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

The authors postulated that progesterone protected against CRC by modulating the effects of estrogen on carcinogenesis. 11 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Iraq concerning the role of ER and PR in colorectal carcinogenesis and showed that there is a gradual increase in ER and PR expression from control through adenoma to carcinoma in terms of frequency of positive cases and frequency of cases with strong intensity of staining, as well as the three digital parameters of immunohistochemical staining (A, N and I). The frequency of ER and PR expression in colorectal cancer was (42.42%, 36.36%, respectively), and there was a significant positive correlation of ER and PR in both adenoma and carcinoma. Concerning the clinicopathological parameters; the present work found a nonsignificant correlation of ER and PR immunohistochemical expression with the clinicopathological parameters studied. The data suggests that these receptors have some role in the process of colorectal carcinogenesis; however, their expression could not predict the risk of malignant transformation of premalignant lesions (adenoma) or the malignant biological behaviors of colorectal cancer.\n\n Comparable studies, either biochemically or immunohistochemically, revealed contradictory data.", "qa": [["25_32266849_1_1", "What is the role of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in the development of colorectal cancer?\n", "Estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) are expressed in normal mucosa, malignant colon, and rectal tissues.

These expectations are a concern firstly for the editor, then for the publishing team. Except for last year, Thomson Reuters' InCites Journal Citation Reports (JCR) is published in mid-June. This report includes the total number of citations of journals, the journal impact factor (IF) and other assessments.\n\n A universally accepted or indisputable method for scientific ranking of journals has yet to be found. Along with the journal impact factor, JCR also publishes other assessments to be considered in ranking. Actually, we will only be able to understand in many years, how a scientific journal, particularly biological and medical publications will eventually serve the public. The best evidence for this is that several times the Nobel Prize is only able to be recognized many years after a scientist has died. Thus, it is important to account for the impact factor (IF) over years. The higher the IF value of scientific journals, the more they are appreciated. As a result, more publications are submitted for ranking, articles are qualified as more scientific than others are cited, and consequently their IF value increases. Although this cycle is abused in several ways, it is unavoidably valid until a better solution is found. IF value also influences the social and scientific lives of scientists. Particularly in the recent advancements and assignments in Turkey, it is taken into consideration by officials and even recognized as threshold. Many countries and publishing institutions try to resolve this issue with imitated methods, and they almost want to delude the researchers. Naturally, there is competition in the scientific world, too, but this competition should remain within the boundaries of honesty, and it should not be self-evident.\n\n Thomson Reuters published the 2015 report in its Journal Citation Reports (Science Citation Index) this year. In it, 124 journals were ranked under the \"Selected Category Scheme: WOS\" in the cardiovascular system. Although its SCI Impact Factor score (0.130) was given, no Turkish journal appeared in this section of the report, and the report ended with an IF score of 0.176. The ranking of the cardiovascular scientific journals included on this list changes every year, and these journals are able to get to the top ranks by enhancing the score of another journal in the lower ranks despite increasing their IF scores. For example, JACC was in first place with an IF score of 16.503 in the 2014 SCI-E ranking, and it maintained its position with a one point increase. While Eur Heart J Suppl (17.759) was in second place, it does not appear on the list this year. Circulation rose from fourth place to second rank with a score increasing from 14.430 to 17.047, whereas Eur Heart J. remained in third place although its score fell from 15.203 to the 15.064. Circulation Research rose from fifth place to fourth and was substituted by Nature Reviews Cardiology.\n\n The place of The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology was also changed in this ranking. While it was ranked 105 th with a score of 0.927 in 2014, it made the cut by surpassing the psychological barrier of a score of 1 and made it to the top 100 cardiovascular publications by increasing its score to 1.141. It also got the highest IF score among the cardiovascular journals published in Turkey's geographically neighboring countries in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean (excluding Revista Espanola de Cardiologia). What surprised Turkey is that its one of the important neighbors, Greece, had the Hellenic Journal of Cardiology ranked 107 th . While the immediacy index of The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology in JCR was 0.435 last year, it rose to 0.828 and was promoted to 53 rd place. Since The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology is an international publication, it is only compared to other international cardiology journals. On the other hand, it can be compared to other scientific journals published in Turkey. The category, \"journals from countries/territories-Turkey,\" listed 62 SCI-E journals this year. While The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology was in tenth place among Turkish scientific journals in the 2014 JCR report with an IF score of 0.927, this year it rose to ninth place with a 1.141 IF score. Its immediacy index also ranked first by a landslide with a score of 0.828. In this JCR report for Turkey, The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology was promoted from the fifth place to fourth in the medical journal IF ranking with a one point increase in its score.\n\n Consequently, The Anatolian Journal of Cardiology, which has been indexed in the JCR of SCI-E since 2007, is regarded as an exceptional journal that constantly increases its IF score every year without exception in spite of the changes in office staffing, associate editors, owners, publishers and editor.

For specialists, dumping referred to a GP's inactivity in an area of care previously perceived as obligatory (e.g., \"out of hours,\" in the provision of continuing care, or in the specific clinical management of a condition), which was then felt to result in additional workload for secondary care. Some specialists suggested that in some instances (e.g., the management of childhood constipation), practices may have managed a patient \"in-house,\" but were now more likely to refer to secondary care. The following specialist expressed dissatisfaction in GP colleagues in this regard, seeing \"out of hours\" care as an essential part of working as a healthcare professional:\n\n For GPs, in contrast, dumping was related to perceived work transfer (from secondary to primary care) without discussion or subsequent resource reallocation. This work transfer included, for example, responsibility for following up results of secondary care initiated investigation, and the follow-up of patients in the community (where there was a perception of patients being discharged too soon from hospital).

It can be mistaken for a breast carcinoma due to its vague clinical, radiological, and histological features [1] . We report a case of NF of the breast previously misdiagnosed as breast carcinoma.\n\n An 18-year-old, previously healthy female patient had been seen by a physician in a different hospital with the complaint of a painless lump in the upper outer area of her left breast. The breast examination had revealed a palpable mass located in the 1 o'clock position of her left breast, but no nipple discharge nor nipple retraction, and no axillary nor supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography had shown a superficially located hypo-echoic lesion measuring 8 \u00d7 5 mm in diameter. Excisional biopsy had been performed under local anesthesia and the diagnosis of a mesenchymal tumor with spindle cells had been made on histopathologic examination. The patient was then referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Physical examination was not contributory apart from a surgical scar in her left breast. The rapid growth of this lesion in this young female patient with no past medical and family history led us to a clinical impression of a benign pathology. Therefore, the stained paraffin sections were revised and the final diagnosis of NF was made.\n\n NF, which was first described by Konwaler et al. [2] , is a benign proliferation of myofibroblasts characterized by its com-mon location in the subcutaneous tissues of the upper extremities, the head and neck [3] . The most characteristic feature of NF is a single, rapidly growing mass [4, 5] . It is reported to occur in young adults between 20 and 35 years of age. Males and females are equally affected.\n\n According to Squillaci et al. [7] , NF has been rarely described in the female breast, with fewer than 15 histologically proven cases reported in the literature. The etiopathogenesis of NF is unknown. However, it is believed that local injury may trigger the fibroblastic proliferation [3, [6] [7] [8] . The history of trauma was elicited in no more than 10-15% of patients [4] . There was also no history of trauma in our case.\n\n NF of the breast forms a hard mass and appears to be irregular in shape on physical examination. Mammography reveals an irregular, often spiculated lesion and ultrasonography detects an infiltrative mass without a capsule [1, 3, 6] . These suspicious imaging features of NF are alarming enough for a breast carcinoma [1, 4, 6] . A literature review of 11 patients with NF reported by Brown and Carty [4] showed that mammography findings were suspicious in 2 patients and consistent with malignancy in 4 patients. In this case, mammography had not been performed prior to surgery due to her young age, and ultrasonographic examination showed a superficially located hypo-echoic lesion. Because NF has no unique radiological appearance [1, 8] , the exact diagnosis can only be made on histopathologic examination [1, 7, 8] . Neither fine-needle aspiration cytology nor core needle biopsy easily diagnoses NF because it is difficult to obtain representative cells to make a correct diagnosis by these techniques [1, 7] . The diagnosis usually requires the histopathologic examination of an excisional biopsy [1, 3, 4, 6] .\n\n The key cytologic features for diagnosis are plump, immature fibroblast-like spindle cells in a myxoid material, chronic inflammatory cells, capillary proliferation, and vascular channels with extravasated red blood cells [4] [5] [6] [7] . In this patient, proliferation of spindle-shaped to plump fibroblastic cells in collagenous stroma was seen. These cells had oval and palestaining nuclei hardly varying in size and shape and without atypical mitotic features ( fig. 1) .\n\n The differential diagnosis of NF includes fibromatosis, myofibroblastoma, granulation tissue, radial scars, phyllodes tumor, sarcomatoid carcinoma, primary sarcoma, and metaplastic carcinoma [1, 6, 7] . NF can be differentiated from these entities on the basis of cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, collagen content, and growth pattern [7] .\n\n For the treatment of NF, either conservative management or excisional biopsy can be chosen. A conservative approach is appropriate if the lesion has a typical clinical appearance, with the core biopsy consistent with NF [4] . Spontaneous regression has been observed [4, 6] . If these criteria are not met, excisional biopsy is the effective treatment, and no further treatment is necessary [3, 7] . Recurrence following surgical excision is rare [4, 7, 9] . We recommend conservative management provided that confirmation of NF is made clinically and histologically. Otherwise, surgical excision should be performed in equivocal cases.\n\n In summary, NF of the breast is a rare lesion that mimics breast cancer clinically, radiologically, and histopathologi cally. Correct diagnosis can only be made on histopathologic examination.

This is consistent with previous literature among physicians and medical students. 3, 4 We would expect that consultant physicians see a spectrum of patients, which contains a higher prevalence and severity of disease than seen by the referring GP, and that this would be incorporated in their estimates of pre-test probability and the baseline risk of subsequent mortality. This study aimed to compare GPs and consultant physicians, in terms of the accuracy of their knowledge of pre-test probability, their understanding of the effect of low and high pre-test probability on the interpretation of the test result, and their ability to predict baseline risk and to understand different presentations of risk reduction.\n\n Questionnaires were mailed to 202 physicians, randomly selected from the members of the Royal College of Physicians in the NW of England and to 205 GPs randomly chosen from the practice list of the NW Health Authorities, and handed to 128 MRCGP examiners attending an examiners meeting. There were 145 examiners (from throughout the UK) at the time, of whom 17 did not attend the meeting. The questionnaire included a case scenario of a 65-year-old man with anginal chest pain, and asked for an estimate of the likelihood of true ischaemic heart disease (IHD) being present, and a case scenario which asked for risk estimates of subsequent mortality in a 55-year-old woman with congestive heart failure (CHF) (see Appendix). Demographic factors, including age, gender, practice profile, specialty and post-graduate studies, were also included in the questionnaires. Doctors were asked to mail the replies back; one reminder was sent to non-respondents 2 weeks later. Following receipt of the response, a second questionnaire was mailed. This presented the scenarios again, but for the angina scenario probed the understanding of the influence of increasing age on the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative test results, and for the CHF scenario probed the understanding of the influence of increasing age on the number needed to treat (NNT). A separate question presented estimates of benefits in terms of NNT, relative risk reduction and the impact on the population (using treatment of CHF with \u2424-blockers as an example) and asked whether the form of presentation would influence the decision to start treatment.\n\n The distribution of responses for pre-test probabilities and baseline risk are shown as box and whisker plots. Frequencies are presented for all other questions, and comparisons of responses were made using the chisquare or McNemar's test.\n\n Responses to the initial questionnaire were obtained from 115 of the 202 physicians (57%), 106 of the 205 GPs (52%) and 81 of the 128 RCGP examiners (63%).

[2] In this disease an atrophic scar remains after treatment. [3] Acute inflammation caused by the infection leads to collagen destruction that forms scar subsequent to the leishmaniasis wounds. [4] Seventy to seventy-five percent of all cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases in the world are found in ten countries; Iran, as a tropical country, is one of them. [5] Fars, Esfahan, and Kerman provinces are the three regions of Iran with a high prevalence of CL. [6] Amastigote eradication and promoting the healing process with minimal scarring are the goals of CL treatment. Pentavalent antimony compounds (pentostam and Glucantime) have been used for the treatment of leishmaniasis. [7, 8] However, they have exhibited various toxic effects on pancreas, heart and liver tissues. [7, 9] Moreover, many studies have been conducted with the aim of finding new treatments, with greater healing impacts and fewer side effects, particularly for CL, in order to improve the wound healing process and decrease scar formation; [10, 11] thus, investigations for finding more efficient and less toxic agents are still in progress.\n\n Taurine (2-aminoethansulphonic acid; Tu) is one of the most abundant amino acids and plays physiological and pathological roles in the human body, in the form of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. [12, 13] Rapid re-epithelization may be induced by Tu due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, the two main reactions that play important roles in the process of wound healing. [14, 15] Finding more beneficial agents to enhance and improve the wound healing process and reduce scar formation in leishmaniasis-induced skin wounds has always been a concern for researchers.\n\n In this study we aim to introduce Tu as a potent healing agent, which is exhibited to be effective on skin wounds caused by CL in mice, based on stereological analysis; we have also presented a flow cytometry (FCM)-based assay for studying the in vitro effects of Tu on L. major promastigotes.\n\n \n\n In an experimental study, Leishmania major amastigotes (MHOM/76/ER) were provided from a group of BALB/c mice that were already infected. We used a final concentration of 4-5000 amastigotes per ml (estimated by means of hemocytometer) to infect the mice in our study. Eighteen mice, aged about four weeks and weighing about 18 g, were obtained from the Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran. The animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6) with leishmaniasis-induced wounds made on the base of their tails. One group was treated with Tu injection (T1) and the other group was treated with Tu gel (T2), and the control group which received no treatment and had only daily debridement of the wound with distilled water (C). Treatments were carried out every 24 hours for 21 days starting from the day open wounds were observed.\n\n At the end, the animals were sacrificed with a high dose of ether. A full-thickness circular skin sample with a 1 cm margin around the wound area was removed from the wound's site and fixed in buffered formaldehyde for stereological evaluation.\n\n All animal experiments in this study protocol were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and the animal care was in accordance with their moral guidelines.\n\n Taurine was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich\u2122 (St Quentin Fallavier, France).

Despite that, the complications such as acute and chronic graft rejection and immunosuppressive therapy side effects are not yet fully overcome. The progress and development in the field of immunology and successful management of transplantation programs have led to an increase in the graft survival rate in the previous decade, despite the fact that both recipients and donors' age are increasing, e.g. from 1990 until 2004 the median age increased from 43 to 51 [1] .

Improved desensitization protocols and paired kidney exchange programs provide higher rate of successful transplantation for patients who were previously \"untransplantable\", having high titers of donor-specific human leukocyte antigen antibodies [4] . Transplant candidates are ranked on the waiting list by using different objective medical and patient-oriented criteria: HLA-A, B, DR match (the so-termed \"mismatch probability\", age, medical urgency, time period spent on the waiting list, the degree of the previous sensitization of the recipient and distance factor [5, 6] . It has been proved that blood transfusion, pregnancy and previous transplantation lead to alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which represents a significant issue in determining the renal transplantation candidates [7] [8] [9] . Preformed anti-HLA antibodies can cause a positive cross match with a certain donor as well as the need for the usage of more potent immunosuppressive therapy in order to prevent an acute graft rejection and to improve the allograft life span.

Further studies are needed to investigate the potential relationship between altered thyroid function and behavioral problems in children exposed to passive smoking."]]}, {"passage_id": "28_9448770_3", "passage": "Twenty-eight concepts of the questionnaire were linked to the ICF-CY and another 5 meaningful concepts were assigned. Of the meaningful concepts identified, 41.2% could be linked to the ICF-CY component Body Functions. Another 14.7% of meaningful concepts related to Body Structure and 35.2% to Activities and Participation. In total, 8.8% of the meaningful concepts were related to Environmental Factors. Only the item of the scale \"back (back condition)\" was considered not to be linked to a specific ICF-CY category. Therefore, this item was assigned health condition 5 times. For the ICF-CY Body Functions component, a total of 11 meaningful concepts were linked to 14 categories of this component. The categories \"Emotional function\"(b152), \"Body image\" (b1801) and \"Pain in back\" (b28013) were linked most frequently. As for the Body Structure component, 5 meaningful concepts were linked to 5 categories of ICF-CY. Linkage included \"Structure of trunk\" (S760), \"Structure of head and neck region\" (S710), \"Structure of upper extremity\" (S730) and \"Structure of lower extremity\" (S750). The component Activities and Participation was represented with categories and 12 linkages. Major categories of activities and participation levels were mapped, such as \"a school education\" (d850), and \"activities and participation (A&P)\". The Environmental Factors component was represented with a total of 3 categories and 3 linkages in SRS-22 PQ. These included categories in human environmental functioning, such as \"Individual attitudes of health professionals\" (e450) and \"Drugs\" (e1101) ( Table III) . \n\n This cross-sectional study identified relevant areas of functioning and disability among patients with AIS based on the perspective of the patients. To our knowledge, it is the first study to explore functioning and disability among a sample of patients with untreated scoliosis from low to high severity in China (22) . The most common issues raised by patients were related to mobility of joint functions, body image, spinal cord and related structures, joining in a game and recreation and leisure. The main contextual factors identified in the study were related to products and technology, supports and relationships, attitude and policies related to health, education, and social services. A comprehensive list of categories covering ICF-CY components was identified, which will provide key aspects for professionals to consider when assessing the population of patients with AIS. Furthermore, these findings provide further evidence to support the development of the ICF Core Sets for patients with AIS in China. Meanwhile, our data could be integrated into international data to develop the ICF Core Sets for AIS.\n\n In our study, patients with a Cobb angle \u226540\u00b0 had a negative view of their body function, body structure and described limitation in their activity and restriction in participation. Conversely, patients with a Cobb angle \u226420\u00b0 had a positive view of their ability and reported their strengths and facilitating factors. The discordance between the perspectives of the 3 groups in this study may be due to the severity of scoliosis resulting in a different expectation of ability (23, 24) . In the component Body Functions, most patients' problems were identified as mobility of joint functions and weight maintenance functions disorders, especially in group 3. These are the most common problems in patients with AIS and lead to a significant negative effect on patients' daily lives and quality of life (25, 26) . In addition, the majority of patients focused more on decreased exercise tolerance, low muscle endurance, body image, pain in back and gait disorders, which were the common symptoms and problems in patients with AIS (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . Interestingly, our result found that all patients with a Cobb angle \u2265 40\u00b0 have a negative view of their body image, which may be lead to a higher impairment of temperament and personality disorders and emotional disorders than others groups. In the component Body Structure, not all patients described impaired body structures in the spinal cord. Scoliosis was not identified as a problem area for some patients with a Cobb angle \u2264 20\u00b0. This inconformity between Body Structures and presentation of patients was described in other studies (33) . In the component Activities and Participation, most patients talked about a lack of enjoyment in games, recreation and leisure. Our result is in accord with a previously reported study that identified that most patients with AIS have lower social participation than healthy peers (34) . In addition, some patients with severe scoliosis reported that they felt awkward, shy or embarrassed with some strangers. Families and physiotherapists should provide more support and help to patients with embarrassment (35) .", "qa": [["28_9448770_3_1", "What are the common issues raised by patients with untreated scoliosis in terms of functioning and disability?\n", "The common issues raised by patients with untreated scoliosis in terms of functioning and disability include mobility of joint functions, body image, spinal cord and related structures, joining in a game and recreation, and leisure.

An essential element of such a network is its operational basis, i.e. the biodosimetric assays. Seven biodosimetric assays were tested and harmonized within RENEB: five using human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and two using smartphones. The former five included the dicentric test (DIC), chromosome painting (FISH), the micronucleus test (MN), premature chromosome condensation by cell fusion (PCC) and the gamma H2AX focus test (gH2AX). The two latter methods electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) in display glass of smartphones and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) in resistors. EPR and OSL are physicochemical methods, so strictly speaking, cannot be regarded as biodosimetric assays. However, since they are designed for retrospective assessment of the individual dose, we will continue using this term for the sake of simplicity.\n\n The applicability of some of the assays (DIC, MN, gH2AX, OSL and EPR) as quick, triage tools for large scale emergencies was tested and optimized in an earlier European Union-funded project MULTIBIODOSE (Wojcik et al. 2014) . In RENEB, we included FISH and PCC and focused on harmonizing the use of all assays so that, in case of a large emergency, laboratories can effectively collaborate to estimate doses and to triage a large number of people. To this end we carried out two intercomparisons during which irradiated blood samples and smartphones were sent to the RENEB members for analysis. We also organized an accident simulation exercise, where the communication and collection of results were tested. The detailed results of these activities are described in separate publications included in this special issue. The aim of this publication is to give an overview of these activities.\n\n The biodosimetric tools used in RENEB DIC is regarded as the gold standard for biological dosimetry because it was invented more than 50 years ago (Bender and Gooch 1962) and its excellent ability to detect an absorbed dose was demonstrated on numerous occasions (Romm et al. 2009 ). The signal stability is not precisely known, but the half- (Whitehouse et al. 2005) . The signal stability of translocations is superior to that of DIC and is in the range of years. MN can be regarded as an outcome of DIC, because micronuclei arise as consequence of chromosomal aberrations. Its advantage is speed of analysis and very good possibility of automation (Willems et al. 2010) . PCC is analogous to DIC; however, thanks to fusion of target interphase cells with mitotic cells, chromosomes can be visualized without the necessity to wait until the target cell reaches mitosis (Terzoudi and Pantelias 1997) . Similar to PCC, gH2AX allow visualizing DNA damage shortly after radiation exposure (Horn et al. 2011 ). Inherent to both methods is a significant decline of the signal within 24 h post exposure. Hence, a good knowledge of the time of exposure is necessary for a proper doses assessment. EPR spectroscopy allows radiation-induced signals to be detected in inert materials such as liquid crystal display and touch screens of smartphones (Trompier et al. 2011; Fattibene et al. 2014) . The main advantages of EPR are its high radiation specificity of radio-induced signals and long-term signal stability (up to several years). OSL is used to assess the dose of ionizing radiation by measuring luminescence emitted from irradiated objects under optical stimulation such as smartphone resistors (Woda et al. 2009 ). Its advantage is high specificity and sensitivity to radiation. The signal half-life is ca. 10 days. A summary of the main characteristics of the assays is given in Table 1 .\n\n The distribution of biodosimetric assays among the RENEB partner laboratories is shown in Table 2 . It is clear that most partners rely on the DIC assay, followed by MN, FISH gH2AX, PCC, EPR and OSL. This distribution of preferences probably reflects various factors such as experience of the laboratory staff and the belief in versatility of the assay for retrospective dose assessment. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that a laboratory dealing with biological dosimetry cannot exclusively deal with radiation emergency preparedness. The reason for this is that there are too few emergencies to justify financing such a laboratory.", "qa": [["0_23093627_0_1", "What are the different biodosimetric assays used in the RENEB project?\n", "The biodosimetric assays used in the RENEB project include the dicentric test (DIC), chromosome painting (FISH), the micronucleus test (MN), premature chromosome condensation by cell fusion (PCC), the gamma H2AX focus test (gH2AX), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)."], ["0_23093627_0_2", "What is the advantage of using the dicentric test (DIC) as a biodosimetric assay?\n", "The dicentric test (DIC) is regarded as the gold standard for biological dosimetry because of its ability to detect an absorbed dose.

Measurement of the control, expression and experience of anger is essential, as is the need to differentiate between different types of anger [2] . Both form an important part of determining if there is a path between an inappropriate manner of anger expression and disease [1] . Specifically, the experience and how anger is managed, have been linked with heart disease both as a risk factor and as an indicator of prognosis [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is also a common characteristic of those seeking mental health treatment [7] and has been shown to be associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [8] [9] [10] , depression and other mental health problems [10] [11] [12] . Anger at how disease can control one's life may also occur and even anger at the ageing process which increases the risk of having a chronic disease [13] [14] [15] . In this context, anger is a commonly experienced emotion and needs to be managed in order to manage illness [16] .\n\n Generally, studies linking anger and health, have been dominated by measurement issues, in particular, the work of Spielberger [2] . Speilberger was instrumental in constructing scales and inventories which measure anger as an emotional state with different intensities and personality traits and determine how prone an individual is to anger [2] . Using a population based sample, Schieman [17] used an index created from responses to three variables (how many times in the last 7 days participants were: outraged at something someone had done; mad at something or someone; angry at someone), to demonstrate that age and socioeconomic status were inversely related to the frequency of anger. More recently, Okuda et al. [7] determined that the population prevalence of inappropriate, intense or poorly controlled anger was 7.8 %. Anger was higher among males, those with a lower socioeconomic status, younger people, those who were unemployed and those widowed, separated, divorced or never married [7] .\n\n Instruments to measure anger have been developed as part of patient education and self-management, to assess emotional responses to illness and determine if emotions such as anger are attributable to particular conditions [18] . The ability to manage emotions, such as health-related anger, are just one of the techniques of self-management programs. These programs enable individuals to reinforce the information received from healthcare providers, with the ultimate aim of improving quality of life [18] . This is essentially the role of all types of support/education groups and has been identified by participants as an important reason for attendance [19] . However attendance at these groups may be limited by factors such as physical limitations, work and time commitments and even disinterest [20] .\n\n Another factor related to anger and health which is receiving increased attention is that of wellbeing. Both health and subjective wellbeing are related and this may become increasingly important among older people as chronic diseases increase with age [21] . The work of Steptoe et al. [21] suggests that older populations experience less anger than middle-aged people, however this pattern differs across populations -high-income Englishspeaking countries appear to have higher levels of anger and stress compared to other countries [21] . These authors highlighted, as a consequence of their study, that health systems needed methods to support improvements in positive psychological conditions [21] . Thus education and information again become important factors.\n\n This paper specifically focuses on health-related anger. While the path from illness to anger is complex and full of interrelationships, this study aimed to examine the demographic characteristics associated with healthrelated anger. Given that this was the focus of the study, information related to health status, health risk factors and beliefs, supports and health service use was also collected and analysed using path analysis, to determine their association with health-related anger.\n\n Data were collected as part of a larger project designed to more fully understand the role of self-care behaviour in peoples' control over their health. The project combined baseline data analysis of previously collected data, focus groups and an Australia-wide population survey conducted in 2011, using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) [22] . Feeling angry about their health was a recurring theme that emerged from a previous Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project grant (DP 0346092: Koch T, Kralik D, Price K, Understanding transition with people living with chronic illness) undertaken between 2003 and 2005 (unpublished observations). As a result, this issue was further explored among the participants during the focus group stage of the current study. The CATI survey development was then informed by some of the qualitative descriptions obtained from participants living with chronic conditions who took part in the focus group discussions [22] .", "qa": [["37_18784362_0_1", "How does anger impact both physical and mental health?\n", "Anger has been linked to both physical and mental health.
