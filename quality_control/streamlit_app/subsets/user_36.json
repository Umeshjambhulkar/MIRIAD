It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

However, the clinical utility of each sequence, and indeed the potential additive benefit of their use together, are yet to be proven. The immediate research priority in renal MRI is focusing on the standardisation and harmonisation of image acquisition across research sites and MRI vendors. This 'ground-up' approach is driven by international, independently funded working groups, including PARENCHIMA [2] , a subsidiary of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action group and the UK Renal Imaging Network (UKRIN), amongst others. As image acquisition is standardised, scientific scrutiny must also be applied to the methods of analysis.

Numerous analytic approaches have been reported to date, and the optimal technique in terms of time and clinical relevance,\n\n are not yet known.

We recognize three main types, based on embryology, anatomy, and suitability for surgical treatment. Pulmonary atresia as an element of a more complex lesion such as transposition of the great vessels or tricuspid atresia is classified under the primary abnormality.\n\n (1) Pulmonary Valve Fusion with Intact Interventricular Septum: embryologically this is the extreme form of simple pulmonary valve stenosis, with complete fusion of the pulmonary valve cusps. An interatrial communication is present, usually a patent foramen ovale, and blood reaches the pulmonary arterial tree distal to the obstructed pulmonary valve by way of a patent ductus arteriosus.\n\n (2) Extreme Fallot's Tetralogy with Pulmonary Atresia: basically the anatomy is that of the tetralogy of Fallot, with a large ventricular septal defect and dextroposed aorta, but the pulmonary valve and sometimes the main pulmonary artery as well are poorly developed and totally obstructed. Right and left branches of the pulmonary artery are present and communicate with each other across the midline. Blood reaches these vessels via a patent ductus arteriosus or bronchial collateral vessels or both. Taussig (1947) originally confined this term to cases with a functioning patent ductus arteriosus, but we extend it to those with bronchial collateral vessels as an additional or alternative source of blood supply to the branches of the pulmonary artery.\n\n (3) Absent Sixth Aortic Arch: we have applied this name to cases in which the entire pulmonary arterial tree fails to develop or is obliterated. In particular the derivatives of the sixth aortic arch of foetal life, the right and left branches of the pulmonary artery, and the ductus arteriosus, are absent or completely atretic. A large ventricular septal defect is present, and the aorta is dextroposed. Blood reaches the lungs by way of one or several large bronchial vessels arising from the descending aorta distal to the origin of the subclavian artery. The present communication is concerned with this group. CLINICAL FEATURES Fifteen cases were available for analysis, with angiographic confirmation in 13 and post-mortem proof in 4.

Disability parallelled the degree of cyanosis, which was slight in 8, moderate in 3, and severe in 4. Haemoglobin varied from 11 -9 g./100 ml. to 22-0 g./100 ml., being less than 15 g./100 ml. in 5 and more than 18 g./100 ml. in 3, with intermediate values in the remainder.\n\n The peripheral arterial pulses were normal in 12 and increased in amplitude in 3 patients. In 2 of the latter, episodes of congestive cardiac failure occurred. Increased right ventricular activity on palpation was noted in most patients, but was slight in the majority. Continuous murmurs were present in all, being loud in 10, moderate in intensity in 3, and soft in the remaining 2 patients.

Millions of cases of chikungunya have been seen in Africa, the Indian Ocean basin, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia since 2005, including thousands in returned travelers. 24 The incubation period is similar to dengue and a similar rash may be present, but severe disease is rare, particularly in children. 25 Treatment is symptomatic, and illness caused by chikungunya is usually self-limited but substantial joint pain may persist. 26 Yellow fever is a serious arboviral disease with a high fatality rate, yet is very rare in travelers because of the availability of an effective vaccine. 27 Other arboviral illnesses may occur, but are rarely reported in travelers. 22 Virtually indistinguishable clinically, 11 typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric fever) are caused by fecaloral transmission of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Risk is higher for VFRs than for traditional tourists and for those who have traveled to the Indian subcontinent, where incidence is highest. 12 Symptoms include fever and abdominal pain, myalgias and arthralgias, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea. 28 Some patients may exhibit a characteristic, if uncommon, \"stepladder\" fever pattern, with febrile temperature progressively increasing over time. 28 Relative bradycardia is a classic associated sign (although also seen with other tropical infections), as are splenomegaly, rose spots, and, occasionally, confusion. 28 Laboratory studies often show a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and liver enzymes are usually elevated.

Patients with optimal or high normal blood pressures would be checked again at the recall appointment (Table II) .\n\n The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure places patients into 1 of 3 risk groups to describe the recommended medical management of hypertension. Important in the defining of the 3 risk groups are major risk factors for hypertension, the presence of target organ disease, and clinical cardiovascular diseases associated with hypertension.\n\n The major risk factors for hypertension are smoking, having hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus, being older than 60 years, being a man or a postmenopausal woman, and having a family history of cardiovascular disease for women under 65 years of age and for men under 55 years of age. Target organ disease (TOD) and clinical cardiovascular disease (CCD) include left ventricular hypertrophy, angina, prior myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization, heart failure, stroke and transient ischemic attack, nephropathy, peripheral artery disease, and retinopathy. 1 Risk group A includes patients with no TOD, CCD, or major risk factors. In this group, patients with high normal blood pressure are managed by lifestyle modification. Stage 1 patients are managed by lifestyle modification for up to 12 months and then drug therapy (Tables III and IV) .\n\n Lifestyle modification is used to prevent hypertension and to manage group A and B patients with high normal blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension. Overweight individuals are encouraged to lose weight. Alcohol intake is limited to no more than 1 ounce of ethanol for men and one-half ounce for women per day. Aerobic physical activity of 30 to 45 minutes for most days of the week is recommended. Individuals are recommended to reduce daily sodium intake to no more than 100 mmol/L or 2.4 grams of sodium or 6.0 grams of sodium chloride. Patients are encouraged to maintain adequate dietary potassium, calcium, and magnesium intake for general health. Patients should stop smoking and reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. 1 \n\n When drug therapy is indicated, the committee recommends that treatment start with 1 drug, low doseage, and then titrate the dosage upward until the blood pressure is controlled. 1 The schedule is dependent on the patient's age, needs, and response to the drug. Optimal therapy is when the drug provides 24 hours of efficacy with 1 daily dose with at least 50% of the effect remaining at the end of 24 hours. The combination of 2 agents from different drug classes by using a lower dose for each drug has been shown to provide increased efficacy and to minimize adverse effects of each drug. The following classes of drugs are used to treat hypertension: diuretics (thiazides, loop, potassium-sparing, combination), adrenergic inhibitors (peripheral, central, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, combined alpha-and beta-blockers), direct vasodilators, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n\n The angiotensin II receptor blockers are a new class of drugs added to the list recommended by the committee. Common drug combinations include betablockers and diuretics, ACE inhibitors and diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers and diuretics, and calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors. 1 Patients with type I diabetes are usually treated with ACE inhibitors. Patients with heart failure are recommended to use ACE inhibitors and diuretics. Older adults with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) are initially treated with diuretics. Other drugs used to treat older adults with ISH are long-acting dihydropyridines, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. 1 If the first drug choice has no or inadequate effect or causes adverse side effects, a drug from a different drug class is selected for use.

Acute respiratory infection and diarrhea are among the major causes of the under-five mortality in Ethiopia. Despite Ethiopia's achievement in the reduction of child mortality, essential interventions such as case management of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea are still low [10] . In the 2011 EDHS report, the general outpatient health care utilization per year was only 0.3 visits. Moreover, only 27% of the children under the age of five with symptoms of ARI sought counsel from a health care facility or provider. Similarly, one out of four febrile children and 32% of children with diarrhea sought care from a health care facility or provider [10, 11] .\n\n Numerous studies have investigated the main determinants of child health service utilization in developing countries.

As a result, health care seeking behavior, health service utilization, and their determinants in the community need to be explored. The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify the main determinant factors that influence equitable medical treatment seeking behavior for common childhood illnesses in Ethiopia using nationally representative data. [11] . The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of children under-five were used for the statistical analysis. A total of 1620 children with diarrhea, 2082 with cough, and 2134 with fever were included in the final analysis.\n\n \n\n The DHS used a population-based, cross-sectional data collection method. The sample for the 2011 EDHS was designed to provide population and health indicators at national and regional levels. The sample was representative of 11 geographic/administrative regions; the samples were selected using a stratified, two-stage cluster design, and enumeration areas (EAs) were the sampling units for the first stage. The samples included 624 enumerator areas (EAs): 187 urban and 437 rural. Households comprised the second stage of the sampling. A complete list of households was drawn up for each of the 624 selected EAs, and representative samples of the 17,817 households were selected. All women aged 15-49 years and all men aged 15-59 years who were either permanent residents of the selected households or visitors who stayed in the households the night before the survey were eligible for the interview.

A child with diarrhea, fever, and cough was identified in the DHS data through respondents/mothers reporting whether the child had diarrhea and/or fever, and/or cough in the 2 weeks preceding the survey period. Medical treatment seeking behaviors for those childhood illnesses were assessed by interviewing respondents/mothers. The respondents/mothers were asked about whether they had sought medical treatment when the child was sick with the above-mentioned childhood illnesses.\n\n The predisposing variables were age and sex of the child, maternal and paternal educational status, age of the mother, household religion, household size and number of under-five children.

Internet could reassure unjustly ''You can be misled. People can describe things that have not been investigated properly. You may get an incorrect explanation. And then consult a physician too late. They are reassured by the things they read. I think that's a disadvantage''. No restriction of information ''I prefer it when you receive the main information first and are then able to find more information if you want. I really like that. And that you don't see all those horrible scenarios that you find quite easily on the internet, I think no body is happy with that. What I want to know is when you should take action.

Therefore, internet did not restrict information to the exact situation, but gave general and broad information. Parents preferred tailor-made information, focusing on their actual situation. Therefore, they considered it necessary that a physician assessed their infant and heard their story. According to most parents, information found on the internet sometimes postponed a doctor's consultation, but in their opinion it hardly influenced their health care utilisation. Parents said to have their own opinion about the situation and had often already decided whether they wanted to consult a physician or not before searching the internet. This decision was made, based on their own judgement, independently of the information they found on the internet or heard from others.\n\n Although parents were looking for reassurance on the internet, they indicated that only a ''face to face'' consult with the physician could give complete reassurance (Table 6 ). According to the parents the physician was the only one who could assess the symptoms in the whole context of the infant. The physician had the capability to examine the infant, evaluate the situation and act directly if necessary.

Some parents discussed the use of a chat-function with the physician; but found that this would reduce the physician into the same category as ''internet'' or ''their neighbours''; someone unable to see the infant and evaluate the whole situation.

In 2 European series, 79% to 97% of patients surviving longer than 20 years with their native liver had cirrhosis, and 46% to 69% had portal hypertension. 14, 15 The near-universal progression of fibrosis and cholangiopathy in the native liver of long-term survivors will certainly necessitate LT as an adult in a large percentage of these patients. Fortunately, LT has developed into a highly effective salvage therapy for those whose BED treatment was unsuccessful. The outcomes have improved year over year, such that nearly 94% of all children who received LT for the treatment of BA are alive 1 year after transplant. 9 As such, BED func- Abbreviations: BA, biliary atresia; BED, biliary-enteric drainage; LT, liver transplant; NA, not applicable; pLT, primary liver transplant; sLT, salvage liver transplant.\n\n tions as a temporizing treatment in most patients. The high failure rate of BED and the excellent success rate of LT raises the question of whether it is time for a paradigm change in the treatment of BA. Specifically, does BED treatment confer a survival advantage when compared with pLT? We used the California OSHPD database to identify all patients with a diagnosis of BA between 1990 and 2015. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those initially treated with BED procedure, regardless of whether they underwent sLT, and those who underwent pLT. Patients in the BED cohort had a lower early mortality rate, but long-term survival was significantly higher among patients in the pLT cohort. We then examined the association of previous BED treatment with post-LT survival. Salvage LT was found to have an increased risk of death compared with pLT. An explanation for this finding may be the well-documented increased technical difficulty of LT in the setting of previous hilar dissection and BDE operation. These patients for whom early BED treatment was unsuccessful are at increased risk of infectious complications and intestinal perforation compared with patients who did not receive BED treatment, which would be anticipated to adversely affect outcome. 8, 16, 17 A substantial interaction effect was observed in the outcomes of LT occurring before and on or after January 1, 2002, when the MELD/PELD scoring system was implemented. Specifically, the increased mortality associated with sLT in the pre-MELD/PELD era was not observed in the post-MELD/PELD era. Substantial improvement in survival after pLT was noted. These findings are in accordance with continued advances in pediatric LT. 17, 18 After the implementation of the MELD/ PELD score for allocation, the number of patients receiving deceased-donor livers has increased and the pediatric waitlist mortality has decreased. In addition, advances in surgical technique, such as partial liver grafts and live-donor LT, as well as improvements in the pediatric intensive care for children before and after LT have contributed to better outcomes.", "qa": [["79_52197611_2_1", "What are the long-term outcomes of biliary-enteric drainage (BED) treatment for biliary atresia (BA) and how do they compare to primary liver transplant (pLT)?\n", "The long-term outcomes of BED treatment for BA have not significantly improved over the years, with a 20-year survival rate of only 21% for patients with their native liver.

Accurate quantification of the symptom relief benefit resulting from chemotherapy can only be provided by a placebo-controlled randomized trial in which all patients receive optimal supportive care. Clearly, in this study, supportive care therapies will have influenced symptomatology. However, given that the vast majority of patients are established on appropriate supportive care at presentation, it seems likely that these measures would dilute only. rather than fully account for. symptom relief associated with chemotherapy.\n\n An important finding in this analysis is that age is not an adverse factor in the palliation of NSCLC. and yet such treatment is usually reserved for younger age groups. The upper age limit in only four of eight authoritative trials of chemotherapy vs supportive care for patients with advanced NSCLC extended to 75 years (reviewed in Shepherd. 1994) , and the average of the median ages in this group of trials was approximately 60 years. There was no evidence from these trials that the elderly fared less well with chemotherapy. The impact of age as a prognostic factor for survival and response in advanced NSCLC has been analysed in a series of recent reports totalling 4516 patients (O'Connell et al. 1986; Albain et al, 1991 : Kawahara et al, 1991 Shinkai et al, 1992; Paesmans et al, 1995) . In one of these. the South West Oncology Group analysed a database of 2531 patients with stage IV NSCLC (Albain et al, 1991) and found by multivariate analysis that age greater than 70 years was in fact a significant independent positive predictor for survival (P = 0.02). In the remainder of these studies, age had no influence by multivariate analysis. Given that more that 50% of patients with advanced NSCLC are over the age of 65 years and the growing elderly population, palliative treatment of the elderly with this disease is likely to be a growing issue, and our data indicate that such patients should not be excluded from palliative chemotherapy trials on the grounds of age alone. Performance status, irrespective of age, would seem to be a much more appropriate basis for treatment selection.\n\n In summary, this analysis of a large database of patients treated in a series of clinical trials demonstrates that even patients with the worst outlook are likely to benefit from palliation with chemotherapy and that age is not an adverse prognostic factor.", "qa": [["31_14853770_2_1", "What are the factors that influence the symptom relief associated with chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC?\n", "The factors that influence the symptom relief associated with chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC include the use of optimal supportive care therapies, the patient's age, and their performance status.

For negative control, ubiquitin zinc-finger protein A20 and CYLD hydrolyze TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2, TRAF6, and Ub K63 on NEMO to yield deubiquitination of NEMO, which results in inactivation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Vereecke et al., 2009; Sun, 2010) .\n\n NLK is an MAPK-like kinase that belongs to the prolinedirected serine/threonine protein kinase superfamily, which consists of MAPKs and cyclin-dependent kinases (Brott et al., 1998; Ishitani et al., 1999) . The NEMO/NLK signaling pathway is important for regulation of cell growth, development, and death. TAK1 is a downstream protein of the NEMO signaling pathway, and participates in P38 MAPK and NLK activation to regulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by ubiquitination of TCE and LET, or as a common central medium to mediate DNA injury induced by the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and P38 MAPK activation, and to initiate the cascade response of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Ohkawara et al., 2004; Keren et al., 2006; Ohnishi et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011) . The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a central role in the secretion of many cytokines, and destroys the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In TNBS-induced colitis, cytokine imbalance was demonstrated by high expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17) and low expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) to induce inflammatory damage to the colonic mucosa.\n\n In the present study, colonic mucosa from rats with TNBSinduced colitis had increased levels of ubiquitinated IKK\u03b3 (NEMO), NF-\u03baB P65, and NLK and decreased level of ubiquitinated NLK. Furthermore, E1 and E2i were activated and highly expressed. In this process, downstream proteins (TAK1 and P38) were phosphorylated and activated; however, CYLD was not ubiquitinated and hydrolyzed to maintain high expression. These results suggest that the mechanisms of NEMO ubiquitin-binding domains with E1 and E2 were initiated and played an essential role in activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in TNBS-induced colitis.\n\n There are only a few reports of SSW regulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway to treat various diseases (Liu et al., 2012 (Liu et al., , 2015a . It is reported that the main effective constituents of SSW, which include rutaecarpine, evodiamine, schisandrin B, and psoralen, have similar effects in different diseases. For example, rutaecarpine significantly decreased NF-\u03baB protein levels in liver tissues and plasma inflammatory cytokines levels to ameliorate pathological changes in the liver, and blocked NF-\u03baB p50/p65 in human colorectal cancer (Nie et al., 2016; Sui et al., 2016) . Evodiamine inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation to inactivate NF-\u03baB expression to relieve zymosan-induced inflammation (Fan et al., 2017) . Schisandrin B or psoralen ameliorated chondrocyte inflammation and osteoarthritis, oxidative stress injury, and DSS-induced colitis via suppression of the NF-\u03baB/MAPK signaling pathways, followed by decreased inflammatory cytokines (Liu et al., 2015a,b; Li et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Ran et al., 2018) . We have previously found that SSW inhibited P38 MAPK mRNA expression to downregulate colonic epithelial cell apoptosis in colonic mucosa in mice with colitis (Zhao et al., 2013) . We deduced from the above that SSW may treat IBD by inhibiting activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway; however, the mechanism of action remains unclear.\n\n SSW contains Semen psoraleae, Fructus evodiae, Semen myristicae, and Schisandra chinensis; it was usually used to treat chronic colitis and showed a therapeutic effect in animal models of TNBS-or DSS-induced colitis (Liu et al., 2012 (Liu et al., , 2015a . In the present study, expression of ubiquitinated IKK\u03b3 (NEMO), NF-\u03baB P65, and NLK was inhibited in the colonic mucosa of rats with experimental colitis treated by SSW, while the levels of E1, E2i, and E3 were decreased, and synchronously the phosphorylation of TAK1 and P38 was limited. These results show the therapeutic effect of SSW in TNBS-induced chronic colitis. We found that SSW inhibited ubiquitination of the NEMO/ NLK signaling pathway to inactivate the NF-\u03baB pathway.

Fructose appears to be at least partially responsible for this detrimental relationship, as fructose metabolism is unregulated [6, 7] and fructose has been linked to greater adiposity and metabolic disturbances compared to other sugars that appear to be especially important during critical periods of growth and development [8] . While many studies have examined the impact of fructose and other sugars on body weight in childhood, few studies have examined the impact of early exposures to these sugars during infancy [9, 10] .\n\n One of the most direct routes by which infants may be exposed to fructose and other sugars is through breastfeeding. During the first six months of life, many infants obtain their nourishment predominately if not exclusively from breast milk, which contains a variety of macronutrients and other relevant factors (e.g., cytokines, appetite hormones) [11] [12] [13] . While this exclusive breastfeeding period would appear to preclude any access to fructose exposure in early-life, studies have shown that the composition of breast milk is shaped by the maternal diet [14, 15] . Therefore, breast milk may contain varying levels of maternal dietary macronutrients that have the potential to contribute to childhood obesity and future metabolic disease risk [16] [17] [18] [19] . For instance, in infants born to mothers diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM), consuming greater volumes of 'diabetic' milk in the first week of life has been found to be associated with a 2-fold increased risk of being overweight at age 2 [20] . This effect is attributed, in part, to the higher levels of glucose and insulin observed in the breast milk of mothers with GDM [21, 22] . Breast milk concentrations of glucose and insulin have also been found to positively predict adiposity in infants born to non-diabetic mothers [12] . Recent research suggests that even non-nutritive carbohydrates found in breast milk (i.e., human milk oligosaccharides) have the potential to contribute to infant growth and body composition in infancy [23] . Together, these studies highlight the need to better understand the composition of breast milk and whether macronutrient composition affects infant growth and development.\n\n The first aim of this study was to determine whether fructose was detectable in human breast milk. The second aim was to examine if fructose in breast milk was associated with infant weight and body composition at six months of age. We tested this hypothesis within a cohort of 25 mother-infant pairs where infants were exclusively breastfed, analyzing relationships between breast milk sugar composition and infant growth and body composition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the associations between breast milk fructose and infant body composition.\n\n \n\n Thirty-seven mother-infant dyads were enrolled at 1-month (\u00b15 days) of age for participation in a 6-month longitudinal exclusively breastfeeding growth study. Of the 37 mother-infant pairs initially enrolled in this study, 25 were retained in this analysis. Eleven participants were excluded due to loss of follow-up for milk analyses (either due to dropping out or declining to produce a milk sample) and another participant was excluded because they did not produce enough breast milk for analysis. The overall study design and preliminary results were described in a previous study that examined the relationships between breast milk hormones and inflammatory markers [12] . The data reported here describe relationships between infant body composition and breast milk sugar content that were not explored in the previous work. In brief, participants were instructed to arrive at the University of Oklahoma approximately between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. with the mother fasted at least 3 h. Upon arrival, a single breast-milk expression was obtained from the mother with a whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan conducted on the infant.

As a consequence, she and her physician will ultimately need to make a decision about postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy. This treatment has been used for several decades, but there is a surprising lack of consensus about when and how to use it. The initial goal of estrogenreplacement therapy was to alleviate menopausal symptoms. More recently, the possibility has emerged that estrogen can reduce morbidity and mortality from ischemic heart disease and osteoporosis. However, women and their physicians must balance these apparent benefits against the possibility that estrogen therapy might increase the incidence of cancer of the breast and uterus or mortality from these diseases. 1 The situation has been further muddled by the increasing use of hormone-replacement therapy -that is, estrogen and a progestin in combination. This practice reflects unequivocal evidence linking unopposed estrogen therapy to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, pathologic changes that are prevented by the cyclic or continuous administration of a progestin. Indeed, this risk of estrogen therapy was confirmed in the recent report of the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial, a three-year randomized trial of placebo, unopposed estrogen, or three estrogenprogestin regimens in 875 postmenopausal women. 2 This study found that the risk of adenomatous or atypical endometrial hyperplasia was about 1 percent among women randomly assigned to placebo or to any of the estrogen-progestin combinations, whereas it was 34 percent among women assigned to treatment with estrogen alone. Endometrial cancer was not an end point of the trial, but evidence from other sources shows an increase of up to sixfold in the incidence of endometrial cancer among women receiving estrogen-replacement therapy 3 ; the concurrent use of a progestin markedly reduces this risk. Thus, the use of estrogen and a progestin combined is increasing among postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who decide to begin replacement therapy.\n\n What about hormones and the breast? Epidemiologic studies and studies in animals strongly implicate estrogen in the development of breast cancer. Recent metaanalyses of data on estrogen-replacement therapy and the risk of breast cancer suggest that there is little risk associated with past use or short-term use of estrogen, but it has been estimated that the risk of breast cancer after 10 years of estrogen therapy is increased by 15 to 30 percent. 4 Information about combined hormonereplacement therapy and the risk of breast cancer has been harder to obtain, since many studies were conducted before such therapy became commonplace. The effects of estrogen-progestin therapy on the uterus and the breast may differ considerably. During the menstrual cycle, the mitotic activity of endometrial cells peaks during the early follicular phase (a time of increased estradiol production) and decreases during the luteal phase (a time when both estrogen and progesterone are produced). In contrast, most proliferative activity in the breast occurs during the luteal phase. Thus, estrogen plus progestin might increase the risk of breast cancer more than estrogen alone. 5 Indeed, a study by Bergkvist et al. 6 suggested just that -an increased risk with combined estrogen and progestin therapy, especially prolonged therapy. However, the types of estrogen-replacement therapy used in that study differed from those used in the United States, where most women receive conjugated equine estrogen.\n\n In this issue of the Journal, Colditz et al. 7 describe the effects of adding progestin to estrogen therapy in a U.S. population, the Nurses' Health Study cohort. The report is based on 1935 cases of invasive breast cancer identified among postmenopausal women in the parent study during 725,550 person-years of follow-up. Most women took conjugated equine estrogen, and the study spanned the decade of the 1980s, when combined hormone-replacement therapy became substantially more common. The analysis showed that the relative risk of breast cancer was 1.32 for women who were currently receiving estrogen alone and 1.41 for women receiving estrogen plus a progestin. Thus, the addition of progestin to estrogen had no significant effect on the risk of breast cancer. The risk among past users or current users who had been taking hormones for less than five years was similar to that among postmenopausal women who had never taken hormones. However, the relative risk was 1.71 among women 60 to 64 years of age who had been receiving hormonal therapy for at least five years.", "qa": [["83_1097497_0_1", "What are the potential benefits and risks associated with postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy?", "Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy has been used to alleviate menopausal symptoms and has also shown potential benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality from ischemic heart disease and osteoporosis.

Ventriculography suggested a single, large anterior ventricle with no posterior chamber. Aortography revealed a double aortic arch with an intact right cervical but interrupted left segment. The ductus arteriosus was patent. Severe semilunar valve regurgitation rapidly opacified the large anterior ventricle. The infant remained in intractable congestive heart failure and died at 20 hours of age.\n\n Postmortem examination. Examination revealed visceroatrial situs solitus, d-ventricular looping and a doubleoutlet right ventricle. The posterior ventricle was hypoplastic and a Rastelli type A complete, common AV canal with a small ventricular septal component was present. The mitral valve was hypoplastic but patent with a cleft in its anterior leaflet (Fig. 7) . The interatrial communication resulted in a common atrial chamber. The interventricular septal defect in the endocardial cushion segment was small with a dense matrix of thickened chordae inserting on its crest. Both great vessels were totally related to the right ventricle; however, the outflow tract was partitioned by a 1 Second --- broad, nonobstructive muscle bundle. The pulmonary valve was anterior and leftward. The dilated main pulmonary artery was continuous with the descending aorta across the ductus arteriosus. The juxtaductal aorta was narrowed but not restrictive. The proximal ascending aorta arose from the right ventricle to the right of the pulmonary root.\n\n The striking feature of the cardiac anatomy was the absence of cusps in the aortic root (Fig. 8) . The aortic endothelium below the two coronary ostia formed shallow, nonobstructive flat ridges with no apparent functional organization. The remainder of the postmortem examination was remarkable for interruption of the suprarenal vena cava with azygous continuation of venous drainage to the left superior vena cava. In addition, a double aortic arch was present with hypoplasia of its left segment. The right superior vena cava was absent and the left superior cava drained anomalously to the right atrium.\n\n The spleen was represented by multiple discrete nodules in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. An unobstructed midgut malrotation was present.\n\n This case illustrates the utility of gated pulsed Doppler study in examining complex cardiovascular anomalies during diagnostic fetal echocardiography.

Antenatal presentation, however, of these lesions is unusual. Major intra-and extracardiac anomalies are palliated by in utero patency of the ductus arteriosus and shunting across the foramen ovale.\n\n Antenatal and postpartum two-dimensional echocardiography.

Finally, we also include indicators for the child's gender and fi rst-born, and state and birth-year fi xed effects to control for differences in access to and price of health care across states and over time. This extensive set of controls captures variation across siblings in parents' capacity to invest and, perhaps, motivation to make prenatal and postnatal investments. 8 We use the number of LBW siblings present in the family at the time of investment in child i to measure siblings' endowment rather than, for example, the total number of LBW siblings ever born in the family, in order to account for investments made in children before their siblings are born. Our model assumes that parents condition parental investment in child i on the birth weight of all siblings that are alive at the time of investment in child i rather than the birth weight of all siblings ever born, including those born after time t. Thus, NLBW -i = 0 for children whose siblings have yet to be born, which refl ects our assumption that investments in a child at that point in time are unaffected by the possibility that the child's future siblings could be LBW.\n\n The model in Eq. (3) is estimated using three alternate specifi cations for own birth weight: (1) continuous birth weight, (2) an indicator for LBW, and (3) indicators for three birth-weight categories (2,500-3,299 grams, 3,300-3,699 grams, and \u2265 3,700 grams). This latter specifi cation will allow us to examine whether investment responses to birth-weight differences are restricted to certain parts of the birth-weight distribution. For example, using indicators for birth-weight categories as measures of own endowment would allow us to test whether the sibling with a relatively higher birth weight receives more or less parental investment than the sibling with a lower birth weight, conditioning on NBW siblings.\n\n For purposes of comparison, we also report estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions that control for child's race and number of siblings in the household in addition to the covariates listed above. Standard errors are adjusted in all models by clustering at the mother level. Results from linear models are reported in the article, although estimates from logit fi xed-effects models (conditional logit) showed the same pattern of results.\n\n Note that compensating or reinforcing parental investment need not solely result from deliberate actions of parents. The ability of parents to engage in compensating or reinforcing investments can be infl uenced by circumstances outside their control. For example, a LBW child in the hospital may be more likely to receive parental investments than the NBW sibling because these investments are critical for her recovery. On the other hand, despite wanting to invest more in the LBW child, parents may be unable to do so simply because of the child's inability to receive the investment. 9 For example, LBW babies who need to 8. We do not control for selective child mortality because child mortality rates in the United States are only about 6 per 1,000 live births. We also do not control for differences in pregnancy or labor complications across siblings. These might be correlated with birth weight and might also alter parental concern for the child. Robustness checks reported later in the article potentially address this concern. 9. It is unlikely that medical advice or treatment may be a reason for differences in breast-feeding and immunization between LBW and NBW siblings, since the benefi ts and safety of these investments in premature and LBW infants are well-documented in the medical literature (Saari and Committee on Infectious Diseases 2003; Smith et al. 2003) be placed in an incubator for a period of time may be too fragile to be breast-fed. Comparing estimates from models with a LBW indicator to estimates from those with indicators for NBW categories, as described above, may shed some light on whether such remedial interventions are at work. In other words, if the effect of birth weight on investments is seen even among NBW siblings, then there is less likelihood that it is the result of these remedial (or compulsory) interventions. Later in the article, we show results from models that investigate this issue in more detail.\n\n We use data from the NLSY-C, which contains detailed information about the children born to female respondents of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). The NLSY79 began in 1979 with a sample of 12,686 young adults between the ages of 14 and 21.

Intravenous pyelography showed markedly decreased hydroureteronephrosis. Only a small port-site scar was visible on the flank; thus the esthetic outcome was acceptable.\n\n MCDK is one of the most common congenital urinary tract malformations. The development of the disease is generally attributed to the failure of differentiation of the mesenchymal metanephros and the epithelial cells of the ureteral bud, thereby leading to obstruction and dysregulation of proliferation in the developing kidney. In cases of MCDK, multiple noncommunicating cysts of varying sizes are observed and the kidney is often nonfunctional. In addition, abnormalities involving the contralateral kidney and urinary tract are frequently observed in patients with MCDK. In a systematic review, these associated anomalies were observed in 31.3% of patients; ureterovesical reflux was the most common abnormality (reported in 19.7% of patients), whereas ureteropelvic junction obstruction was reported in 4.8% of patients. 3 However, midureteral stricture was an uncommon associated anomaly in some previously reported cases. 4, 5 In this case report, the late presentation of congenital midureteral stricture is of particular concern. In most cases of congenital midureteral stricture, diagnosis is made in the first few months of life; in very few cases, the diagnosis is made during adolescence. 6 Compensatory hypertrophy is an expected finding in patients with a single functioning kidney. In one long-term, prospective study of 33 children with MCDK, 24% had compensatory hypertrophy at birth and 52% showed compensatory hypertrophy by later childhood. 7 In our patient, midureteral stricture was assumed to develop due to compensatory hypertrophy because hydronephrosis was observed in the hypertrophic right kidney. This suggests that the midureteral stricture was initially nonobstructive, but it progressed as the patient grew older and the urine volume increased subsequently. Congenital midureteral strictures may have a different natural history from ureteropelvic junction obstruction and may require a more aggressive surgical approach.\n\n Treatment options for congenital midureteral stricture include open excision of the area of stricture and ureteroureterostomy 6, 8 and, more recently, laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic resection and ureteroureterostomy. 9, 10 To our knowledge, this is the first report of LESS surgery performed in a case of congenital midureteral stricture. The crucial factor in successful reconstruction for midureteral stricture is the preservation of the ureteral blood supply because the blood supply in the mid ureter is tenuous. The midureteral region is an area of transition because the blood supply to the ureter changes from the abdominal aorta proximally to the iliac and hypogastric arteries distal to the common iliac artery. Goel et al. 11 introduced open nondismembered ureteroplasty for congenital midureteral stricture. In this surgical technique, a longitudinal incision, which is made over the narrowed segment, is closed transversely, thereby preserving the midureteral blood supply. The same principle was used during LESS repair in our patient.\n\n The retroperitoneal approach for LESS repair of upper urinary tract anomalies offers various obvious advantages over the transperitoneal approach. First, the distance from the incision to the ureter is shorter, and mobilization or retraction of the intraperitoneal organs is therefore not required. In our case this shorter distance enabled more direct access for incision and suturing of the ureter along with antegrade stenting through the single port, and this greatly reduced the operation time. Second, because the retroperitoneal approach eliminates the need for violation of the peritoneal cavity, it reduces the risk of injury to the adjacent abdominal organs and spillage of their contents from the hydronephrotic kidney into the peritoneal cavity. Nevertheless, the main disadvantage with the retroperitoneal approach is the limited working space.\n\n In LESS surgery the most difficult and time-consuming aspect of intracorporeal reconstruction of the ureter is suture placement. Several solutions have been proposed, including articulating needle drivers, accessory 2-mm needlescopic trocars, and the Endostitch device (Covidien, Norwalk, CT, USA). Additional developments in instrumentation and technology may help circumvent some of the limitations of current LESS surgery, which result from instrument crowding and relative lack of triangulation. On the other hand, extracorporeal suturing through the port incision, as reported in one case of retrocaval ureter, 12 is another possible solution. In our patient the extracorporeal suturing technique was used for ureteroplasty without a second incision or enlargement of the original incision. This technique decreased the operation time and improved the esthetic outcome as well.\n\n LESS surgery seems ideally suitable for upper urinary tract reconstructive procedures, such as the one performed in our patient. The cosmetic advantage is the most appealing aspect of LESS surgery, particularly for younger patients. However, for LESS surgery to be more widely adopted, other patient benefits beyond the cosmetic advantage must be shown. Further studies are necessary to evaluate potential recovery benefits in LESS surgery when compared with those in standard laparoscopic procedures.\n\n Although it is a technically challenging surgical methodology, retroperitoneoscopic LESS surgery may represent a novel and feasible treatment option for congenital midureteral stricture.", "qa": [["61_43512443_1_1", "What are the treatment options for congenital midureteral stricture?", "The treatment options for congenital midureteral stricture include open excision of the area of stricture and ureteroureterostomy, laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic resection and ureteroureterostomy, and retroperitoneoscopic LESS surgery."], ["61_43512443_1_2", "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the retroperitoneal approach in LESS surgery for upper urinary tract anomalies?", "The retroperitoneal approach in LESS surgery offers advantages such as shorter distance from the incision to the ureter, no need for mobilization or retraction of intraperitoneal organs, reduced risk of injury to adjacent abdominal organs, and reduced risk of spillage of kidney contents into the peritoneal cavity.
