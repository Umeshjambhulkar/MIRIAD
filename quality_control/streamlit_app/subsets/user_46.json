Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

The peroxidation product isoprostane causes greater microvessel vasoconstriction in young compared with adult animals [192] . A combination of vasoconstriction and endothelial cell damage leads to degenerative processes in terminal arterioles and capillaries, inducing anatomical rarefaction [193, 194] .\n\n Potential sources of ROS in the vasculature in relation to developmental programming of elevated BP Vascular ROS are produced in all cell layers and derive from NADPH oxidases, uncoupled NOS, xanthine oxidase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain [195] .\n\n As discussed above, vascular NADPH oxidase has been shown to be a major source of superoxide in some models of developmentally programmed elevated BP. Vascular NADPH oxidase is regulated by multiple factors, including humoral molecules and mechanical forces [195, 196] . Of these factors, AngII appears to be one of the most important, via AT 1 receptor activation [197] . AngII can also increase NADPH oxidase expression [198] .\n\n NOS may contribute to superoxide generation in conditions where l-arginine or BH 4 (tetrahydrobiopterin), both essential for NO synthesis, are deficient [199] ; NOS is then described as 'uncoupled'. BH 4 corrected impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, enhanced NO production and decreased superoxide generation in microvessels of adult offspring of dams subjected to a 50 % reduction in their diet during gestation [200] . All NOS isoforms can become uncoupled, and iNOS (inducible NOS) appears to be particularly sensitive [201] . In SHRs, inhibition of iNOS during pregnancy and lactation reduced BP in the adult, whereas BH 4 supplementation in the adults decreased aortic superoxide production and expression of iNOS, suggesting a role specifically for iNOS uncoupling as a source of superoxide [187] .\n\n Mitochondria can be an important source of superoxide [167] . Reciprocally, mitochondria are also themselves targets of ROS, with damage to mitochondrial lipids, enzymes and DNA, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and greater ROS production [202, 203] . Studies have underlined the prevalence of vascular cells mitochondrial dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes, heart failure and hypertension [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] . Interestingly, there appears to be reduced mitochondrial DNA content in liver and muscle of adult LP offspring [20, 212, 213] . There is also reduced mitochondrial DNA content in kidneys and aorta of hypertensive adult offspring of high-fat diet-fed dams [214] .\n\n Although the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases is well established, the protective role of antioxidant mechanisms remains poorly defined. During the last trimester of a normal pregnancy antioxidant enzyme levels increase. Preterm newborn are, therefore, relatively antioxidant-deficient when confronted with the massive surge in Po 2 (partial pressure of oxygen) at birth. Indeed, virtually all studies of premature, as well as growthretarded, infants demonstrate lower and less inducible antioxidant defences, such as SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase [170, 178, [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] . Interestingly, gender differences prevail in the antioxidant capacity of premature babies [220] [221] [222] , which would need to be correlated with the differential incidence of morbidities in newborns and in adults, as well as the differing mechanisms of hypertension programming between the genders [223] .", "qa": [["60_28794806_9_1", "How does oxidative stress early in life contribute to postnatal microvessel rarefaction?\n", "Increased oxidative stress early in life can lead to postnatal microvessel rarefaction through endothelial cell necrosis, enhanced apoptosis, and perturbation of specific angiogenic factors.

There were no significant differences in immunological parameters between the patients at <45 and >45 y of age. Tolerability of T-cell vaccination was generally satisfactory, with just one episode of local reaction (erythema), and 2 episodes of fever reported. Discontinuation of treatment was not necessary in all episodes of side effects observed, and they resolved unaided. No clinical evidence of actively developing any chronic virus infection or aggravating any allergic disorder was noted in the T-cell vaccine-treated patients over the follow-up period.\n\n Conventional RA treatment is based on longitudinal unspecific immunosuppressive therapy, which down-regulates immune system in general and carries high risk of serious side effects. There is obvious need for novel therapeutic strategies that would selectively inactivate pathogenic lymphocytes as an approach to treat RA and other autoimmune diseases. One such approach is based on vaccination of patients with autoimmune lymphocytes, as it is well known that there is no immune tolerance to lymphocyte antigen receptors formed in the postnatal period, and lymphocyte-lymphocyte idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions play an important role in regulation of the immune system.\n\n In comparison with other treatment strategies, a clear advantage of the T-cell vaccination approach consists in its selectivity that aims specifically at inactivation of those lymphocytes that account for the development of autoimmunity. It is of particular importance that the effect of T-cell vaccination is dependent on several mechanisms and components, such as stimulation of anti-idiotypic immune reactions, induction and stimulation of regulatory T-cell functional activity, induction of anti-idiotypic antibody synthesis etc. Admittedly, there is not yet enough evidence with respect to clinical application of the T-cell vaccination approach. Previously, most studies used cloned T lymphocytes for immunization purposes. However, propagation of human T-cell clones is quite an expensive procedure that requires a lot of time, and is not always successful. Moreover, inactivation of one or several autoimmune clones might not always render a beneficial effect onto disease progression, which could involve polyclonal immune responses directed to multiple antigenic determinants; in such a scenario the importance of a single clone in the autoimmune process could prove to be a minor one. The above considerations sideline the effective clinical application of cloned T-cells in RA treatment, as well as other autoimmune diseases.\n\n We have developed a method that yields sufficient quantity of autoantigen-reactive T-cells within a relatively short period of time. Under these conditions, the vaccine composition is determined by the initial individual T-cell reactivity representing most autoaggressive cells that received selective growth preferences owing to the presence of joint tissue antigens in cell culture.\n\n One of the major aims of the present pilot clinical study was to assess immunological and clinical effectiveness of the proposed treatment protocol. Significant reductions in PBMC proliferative activity to the joint tissue antigens in RA patients indicate immunological effectiveness of T-cell vaccination; this may reflect reduction in antigen-reactive T-cell quantity in those patients. An important role is also played by the alterations in IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 concentrations in plasma and in cell culture supernatants of PBMC from vaccinated patients. Down-regulation of the former cytokine (IFN\u03b3) and up-regulation of the latter cytokine (IL-4) are suggestive of functional rearrangements in the immune system, as well as indicate activation of non-specific immune mechanisms that inhibit immunopathological process. In RA settings T-helper type I-produced IFN\u03b3 is considered to play a pivotal role in recruitment of macrophages and other immunocompetent T-cells to pathological inflammatory sites, whereas T-helper type 2-produced IL-4 is capable of down-regulating the IFN\u03b3-mediated activity, thus causing an anti-inflammatory effect.\n\n Immunotherapy-mediated reduction in central memory T-cells, and in particular effector memory CD8 + T-cells is also a beneficial factor with respect to disease progression due to the fact that CD8 + T-cells producing IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and perforin participate in maintaining chronic inflammation and destruction of joint tissues.\n\n On the other side, down-regulation of the immune reactivity could be achieved via an increase in quantity or up-regulation of functional activity of regulatory CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T-cells, which are capable of causing a adjusting effect both on memory cell generation and effector cell function. 15 The results obtained in the present study also suggest significant clinical efficacy of T-cell vaccination approach, as good and moderate clinical effects were achieved in 87% patients.\n\n Hence, T-cell vaccination opens new possibilities in treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases.", "qa": [["80_3139912_2_1", "What are the advantages of T-cell vaccination as a treatment approach for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis?\n", "T-cell vaccination offers a clear advantage in its selectivity, targeting the specific lymphocytes responsible for the development of autoimmunity.

Climate is thus not expected to be a limiting factor for the establishment of such non-EU Cronartium species.\n\n For the non-EU Cronartium spp. occurring in (sub)tropical areas, climate may be a limiting factor for establishment, unless those Cronartium spp. occur in their native range in mountainous areas with a more temperate climate. Cronartium spp. have windborne aeciospores that can travel long distances (Chang and Blenis, 1989; EPPO, 1997a) . The aeciospores tolerate dry air (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005) .

In recent decades, rapid progression in treatment of various types of atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, has been observed. Ablation within the cavotricuspid and other parts of the right atrium, as well as cardiac resynchronisation therapy, has become a standard approach. The right atrium (RA) and the interatrial septum are not only the direct targets of various interventions but also enable access to left heart chambers. The RA consists of many unique anatomical structures whose presence and morphology not only may trigger the abnormal electric activity of the heart, but also hinder the course of procedures. Precise understanding of heart anatomy and the most frequently observed anatomical variants of atrial structures seems to be crucial for achieving satisfying results, and minimising or avoiding complications during interventional procedures.\n\n This comprehensive summary presents in a thorough but uncomplicated way a detailed macroscopic morphology of RA and interatrial septum. It also provides the anatomical background for the most common atrial arrhythmias and invasive cardiological procedures.\n\n Overview The RA of the human heart is located behind the right ventricle in a rightward direction. It consists of the following parts, namely a venous component, an appendage, and a vestibule. The main body of the RA has an irregular ellipsoid shape with a triangular protrusion of the right atrial appendage from the anterolateral part. All those parts have disparate embryologic origin [1] . The interatrial septum is the part common for both atria, and its detailed anatomy and origin will be described in the next chapter.\n\n Estimated diameters of the RA differ depending on the method of measurement. Using transcatheter echocardiography, the established normal values are: 3.4-5.3 cm (long axis) and 2.6-4.4 cm (short axis) in a four-chamber view at the end-systolic phase of the cardiac cycle along with 4.9-6.1 cm (long axis) and 4.2-5.3 cm (short axis) in a four-chamber view in the phase of maximal size of the atrium in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Nonetheless, currently there is a lack of clearly established standards regarding quantitative evaluation of the size of the RA, since its precise measurements are not particularly relevant to clinical practice [2] .\n\n The superior vena cava (SVC) drains into the RA on its superior wall, and its orifice is localised in the venous component of the atrium [3] . The mean diameter of the SVC orifice oscillates between 20.1 \u00b1 3.2 mm in the mediolateral dimension and 19.2 \u00b1 3.1 mm in the anteroposterior dimension. Previous research provided evidence that the orifice of the SVC is always deprived of any anatomical obstacles [4] . Hence, the SVC should be considered as the preferred access way during catheterisation of the RA in the majority of cases.\n\n The fibromuscular junction between the appendage and the venous component of the RA is externally marked by a terminal groove extending vertically between the superior and inferior caval veins. This structure corresponds to the endocardially marked muscular band known as the terminal crest [5] . The terminal crest stretches from the anteromedial wall of the RA, then it passes parallel to the anterior border of the SVC orifice, and then it curves in a posterolateral direction (Fig. 1) . Close to the inferior vena cava (IVC) it bends anteriorly to get past the right border of its orifice. Subsequently, it ends its track in the region of the cavotricuspid isthmus [6] [7] [8] [9] . The mean length of the terminal crest is 51.0 \u00b1 9.0 mm and its thickness at the level of SVC is about 5.5 mm [10] . Occasionally, the terminal crest can be prominent, thus mimicking a right atrial mass like a pseudo mass, tumour, thrombus, or vegetation. The proximal and intercaval course of the terminal crest is quite universal in all hearts. The pattern of the ramification of the distal part of the terminal crest into the lower part of the RA varies significantly among the population, contrary to its initial and central part.

These implants formed organized tissue in the spine that functioned normally throughout the 16 weeks of the study.\n\n Reconstructing a discectomized intervertebral segment with de novo biological disc implants is an ambitious approach to treating degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. In 2007, the feasibility of whole allogeneic IVD transplantation was demonstrated in a clinical study with impressive results at 10 year follow up [7] . The potential clinical advantages of allogeneic IVD transplantation are limited by the availability of healthy donor discs, possible adverse immune reaction, and potential disease transmission. De novo TE-IVDs, the multi-compartment disc analogs using cells and biomaterials, can potentially overcome these limitations of allogeneic implants and yield favorable outcomes. A variety of in vitro studies and in vivo studies that employed animal models of nucleotomy or partial IVD resection have indicated the promise of using tissue-engineered constructs for disc replacement [9, 11, 13, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] , however, only three translational studies have demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of biological disc implants in the totally discectomized segment [11, 16] .\n\n In the pursuit of a biological construct that can be contained in the interbody cage to reconstruct the segment with non-bony soft tissues, Goldshlager et al. seeded mesenchymal progenitor cells into gelfoam sponges formulated with the chondrogenic agent pentosan polysulfate implanted into fully discectomized sheep lumbar segments in combination with absorbable interbody cages [41] . This study demonstrated the potential of replacing the disc segment with cartilaginous tissues to offer a means of preserving spinal motion, although the reparative tissues were distinct from those of native discs, even accompanied with ossification in some areas or specimens. Xin et al reported the aforementioned allogeneic disc transplantation and demonstrated the feasibility of human telomerase reverse transcription (hTERT) gene-tranfected NP to be incorporated with allograft IVD transplantation in the beagle cervical spine [42] . Although their results demonstrated the feasibility of allogeneic disc-based implant to be combined with genetic engineering, use of exogenous genes can hamper the clinical applicability. Previously, we developed de novo AF/NP composites derived from component cells to produce TE-IVDs, and demonstrated the efficacy of these discs on maintenance of disc height and disc functionality in an in vivo rat model [16] . The implanted TE-IVD integrated, with the host vertebrae, histologically restored the disc constitutive structures (i.e. NP and AF), and physiologically maintained NP hydration over 8 months [19] .\n\n To move this approach toward clinical application, larger animals that have a more upright cervical spine were utilized in the present study. Many breeds of small dogs, such as beagles and dachshunds, develop spontaneous cervical disc degeneration as in humans [23] . Further, previous studies have revealed that canine IVDs are exposed to stress conditions similar to or even higher than those of human discs [21-23, 43, 44] . In addition, the canine spine shows similar anatomical features and analogous degenerative processes with human discs [45] . Besides showing similar pathological changes, canines are also the only animals diagnosed and treated both medically and surgically as humans for their disc degeneration [46] . As such, canine spinal models have been previously used to investigate disc degeneration and to develop surgical treatments such as spinal fusion [47, 48] and regenerative intervention [38] . This is especially true of beagles, which are frequently used for biological approaches aimed at disc regeneration. These canines are classified as chondrodystrophic dogs due to the gradual loss of notochord cells and replacement by chondrocyte-like cells by the stage of skeletal maturity [49] . Notably the absence of such cells at skeletal maturity, which have reparative functions in the intervertebral discs, suggests that such a mechanism is not at play for implanted TE-IVD. In fact, the solely discectomized segments in the present study demonstrated no substantial repair in the disc space.\n\n Moreover, our experiment employing stand-alone TE-IVD implantation under this clinically relevant model gave a fresh insight into development of biological disc treatment.", "qa": [["27_24297122_3_1", "What are the potential advantages of using tissue-engineered intervertebral disc (TE-IVD) implants compared to allogeneic implants for treating degenerative disc disease?\n", "Tissue-engineered intervertebral disc (TE-IVD) implants have the potential to overcome the limitations of allogeneic implants, such as limited availability of healthy donor discs, possible adverse immune reactions, and potential disease transmission.

Such an approach has been applied in bioequivalence studies and also for biotherapeutics [9] , where it was found to give indistinguishable results on the standard NCA parameters (AUC and C max ), as was the case in our analysis. However, as was also argued by Dubois et al. [9] , a PK model can provide valuable insight in the biological systems underlying the PK properties. Although the standard NCA-derived parameters, such as C max , AUC inf , terminal half-life, etc., may seem similar, the two drug products could behave quite differently in terms of PK, a feature that goes undetected in a NCA [27] . Furthermore, similar plasma concentrations do not invariably mean similar concentrations at the site of action.\n\n Here, we describe two methods of incorporating PK modelling in biosimilarity research. The first approach is developing a model on all available data from both test and reference product(s) and carefully examining possible bias in one of the treatment groups. Testing for (statistically) significant differences between drug product can be done for all the model parameters via covariate analysis. Covariate testing follows a well-established statistical distribution that can be used for statistical inference [28, 29] . If no significant correlations can be identified between the drug products and if attempts to incorporate treatment as covariate in the model fail to improve it, the biosimilarity claim is supported.\n\n The second method entails the development of different models, one for each test and reference product(s), which in contrast to a combined model does not assume similarity between test and reference product as a starting point. This method allows comparison of the model structure that should be identical for biosimilar products and of model parameters for both test and reference product.\n\n Comparing different PK models inevitably reveals minor differences for which the clinical significance needs to be discussed. For example, in model T, the optimal inter-compartmental clearances (Q1 and Q2) were estimated to be a factor 10 2 -10 3 higher than the corresponding parameters in the other models, while the striking dissimilarity did not seem to affect the descriptive properties of the overall profiles. However, as the (fictive) second and third compartments were not sampled, this finding merely reflects a mathematical solution to a rather complex problem and not necessarily a true (e.g. physiological or pharmacological) difference. Additionally, the higher dose administered for the reference product could have allowed a better characterisation of the terminal portion of the PK profile (elimination parameters), which also affects the estimation of remaining parameters such as Q1 and Q2.\n\n This represents an important limitation of the second method, which may be of particular relevance when modelling PK data from two different populations separately. Unfortunately, pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of biotherapeutics is regularly investigated in trials of parallel design, because of the long half-life and the potential of antidrug antibodies development, which could influence the pharmacokinetics [30] . Theoretically, all MAbs share common pharmacokinetic properties, e.g. small central volume of distribution, no renal excretion due to large molecular size, metabolism into amino acids and peptides, both specific (non-linear) and non-specific (linear) cellular uptake and degradation elimination mechanisms [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Thus, the remaining variability is probably determined by Geometric mean (GM) (\u03bcg day \u22121 mL \u22121 ) and GM ratio (%) with the 90 % confidence for the labelled dose (6 mg/kg) as derived by different methods per treatment arm. For the NCA results, a linear dose correction was applied; in the models, the labelled dose was used to simulate the individual profiles (see main body)\n\n T test, R reference T test, R reference patient characteristics.

A significant correlation was observed between calreticulin concentrations in the synovial fluid and the tender joint counts (r s \u03ed 0.373, P \u03ed 0.04), swollen joint counts (r s \u03ed 0.370, P \u03ed 0.04), and DAS28 (r s \u03ed 0.440, P \u03ed 0.02). The correlation between calreticulin concentrations and the DAS28 in RA patients was also significant in the plasma (r s \u03ed 0.439, P \u03ed 0.02), but the correlations between plasma calreticulin concentrations and the tender joint and swollen joint counts did not reach statistical significance (r s \u03ed 0.342, P \u03ed 0.06 and r s \u03ed 0.344, P \u03ed 0.06, respectively). A Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was not performed, because this study was focused only on the relationship of joint inflammation and mobility with calreticulin levels, and the mathematical correction is not recommended for a limited number of related comparisons (34) .\n\n Concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in plasma and synovial fluid samples from patients. Measurements of nitrite and nitrate were performed on the patients' samples as an indirect assessment of the gen- (A and B) , the swollen joint count (C and D), and the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) (E and F). Correlations with the calreticulin concentration, as determined by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analyses, were as follows: for plasma calreticulin and tender joint count, r s \u03ed 0.342, P \u03ed 0.059 (A); for synovial fluid calreticulin and tender joint count, r s \u03ed 0.373, P \u03ed 0.039 (B); for plasma calreticulin and swollen joint count, r s \u03ed 0.344, P \u03ed 0.058 (C); for synovial fluid calreticulin and swollen joint count, r s \u03ed 0.370, P \u03ed 0.040 (D); for plasma calreticulin and DAS28, r s \u03ed 0.439, P \u03ed 0.017 (E); and for synovial fluid calreticulin and DAS28, r s \u03ed 0.440, P \u03ed 0.017 (F).

The most common reason for noneligibility at prescreening was diagnosis change (78/314; 24.8%), followed by age > 80 years (75/314; 23.9%), language/distance/mobility (61/ 314; 19.4%), and noncardiac medical problems (53/314; 16.9%), although the relative frequency varied by site (Fig. 1) .

At the Zurich site, only two patients were considered noneligible (due to noncardiac medical problems and nonresponder/allergy).

Of the eligible patients following prescreening, around two-thirds (53/79; 67.1%) had no or low-level pain at the time and were judged to not meet entry criteria for moderate pain and frequent daily paroxysms of pain. Around one-fifth (17/79; 21.5%) declined participation because they did not want to change from their current treatment regimen due to fear of losing pain control. Other reasons for not screening included the patient's preference to receive surgery for severe pain, and reluctance to participate because of previous poor experience with pregabalin and gabapentin, the only permitted concomitant anticonvulsant medications.\n\n At the Rome site, the majority of prescreened, eligible patients did not proceed to screening because of reluctance to change treatment regimen (50/84; 59.5%); other reasons were too little pain (4/84; 4.8%) and preference to receive surgery for severe pain (2/84; 2.4%).

Language/distance/mobility = unable to participate in trial due to language barriers, distance from trial sites, or limited mobility prohibiting attendance at required study visits. Noncardiac medical problems = noneligible because of noncardiac medical issues prohibited under trial entry criteria. Cardiac problems = noneligible because of cardiac medical issues prohibited under trial entry criteria, including Fridericia's formula requirements (< 450 ms in two of three electrocardiograms done at screening).

Similar results were obtained on examining human primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and human primary peripheral monocytes. Herein, we observed increased adhesion of immune cells to renal epithelial monolayer with telocinobufagin treatment of 10 nmol/L for 24 hours. The telocinobufagin effect was also diminished with pNaKtide pretreatment of 1 lmol/L (30 minutes; Figure 1D ). Next, we investigated the role of macrophage NKA a-1-Src signaling in modulating functional cell-cell interactions. We used macrophages that were isolated from either wild-type NKA a-1 +/+ or knockdown NKA a-1 +/\u00c0 mice and treated them with 100 nmol/L telocinobufagin for 24 hours. We found that although telocinobufagin induced wild-type macrophage adhesion to a renal epithelial monolayer (P<0.05; Figure 2A ), the effect was abolished with pNaKtide pretreatment of wildtype macrophages (Figure 2A ) and in NKA a-1 +/\u00c0 knockdown macrophages ( Figure 2B) .\n\n These findings suggest that the NKA a-1-Src signaling complex is an important mediator of CTS-induced functional cell-cell interactions between macrophages and renal epithelial cells. More important, the telocinobufagin compound used in the current study was tested for lipopolysaccharide contamination using a highly sensitive assay that revealed no detectable lipopolysaccharide contamination.\n\n To test the role of CTS signaling on adhesion molecule expression in immune cells, we treated THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line, for 24 hours with 10 nmol/L telocinobufagin. We observed a statistically significant increase in both CD11b and CD18 protein expression with telocinobufagin treatment when compared with the control vehicle treated cells (P<0.01; Figure 3A ). Next, we tested the involvement of Src kinase signaling in telocinobufagin-induced adhesion molecule protein expression using biochemical approaches. We found that pretreatment with the NKA a-1/Src complex inhibitor pNaKtide 11 (1 lmol/L; 30 minutes) attenuated telocinobufagin-induced increase in adhesion molecule protein expression of CD11b and CD18 (P<0.01; Figure 3A) . Similar findings were observed when treating primary human coronary artery endothelial cells for 24 hours with 10 nmol/L telocinobufagin. We found that although telocinobufagin induced increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion protein 1) expression in endothelial cells, this effect was also diminished after inhibiting NKA a-1-Src signaling using pNaKtide pretreatment ( Figure 3B ). We also demonstrated that telocinobufagin (10 nmol/L; 24 hours) upregulates the adhesion molecule VLA-4 (integrin a4b1) protein expression in monocytes (THP-1) ( Figure S2 ).

Therefore, it is likely that in the children in our study, the 4\u2032-hydroxymidazolam metabolite was formed in very low quantities, and subsequently rapidly conjugated and eliminated in urine. 1'-Hydroxymidazolam is as potent as the parent drug [48] ; it may contribute to the pharmacological activity of the drug following oral administration.\n\n Two children had copious amounts of saliva following administration of buccal MDZ, necessitating suction of the airway. MDZ Cmax values of 161 and 63 ng ml -1 were achieved within 5 and 30 min, respectively; these values were within the 95% CI for the group. However, convulsions were terminated in both cases. None of the children had any aspiration.\n\n The pharmacokinetic parameters of MDZ are reported to exhibit a considerable degree of inter-individual variability, particularly in critically ill patients [49] . There was approximately a two-fold variation in plasma MDZ clearance in patients in this study. Hughes et al.

Following administration of buccal MDZ, convulsions were terminated within 10 min in five out of eight children (63%), which is in accord with values (75-78%) reported in previous studies [20, 21, 23] . Buccal MDZ is rapidly effective [44] and in previous studies, buccal administration terminated convulsions within 3-20 min of administration in 56-84% of cases [20, [22] [23] [24] . Buccal MDZ was shown to be at least as effective as rectal diazepam in the acute treatment of seizures [21, 24] . In a recent study of Ugandan children [20] , buccal MDZ was superior to rectal diazepam for treatment of children with prolonged convulsions, but the benefits of buccal MDZ were markedly evident in children with convulsions that were not associated with falciparum malaria. Most of the children in the present study had recurrence of convulsions following initial termination with IV or IM MDZ ( Table 2 ). The incidence of recurrence of convulsions after administration of MDZ has been previously reported: 11-31% for IM [19, 51] , 14-30% for buccal [20, 22, 24] administration, and 57% for continuous MDZ IV infusion for the control of refractory status epilepticus [52] ; this is attributed to the short elimination half-life (about 1-3 h) of MDZ. The relatively lower efficacy of buccal and IM administration compared with IV MDZ may be attributed to a lag in the absorption phase, especially following IM administration. The prolonged absorption phase may be caused by malaria which is associated with decreased peripheral perfusion. One malnourished child had lower Cmax and longer tmax values compared with nonmalnourished children.

Although evidence suggests that avoidance of hyperglycemia (.180 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (,70 mg/dL) is beneficial for positive outcomes in the hospitalized patient, much of this evidence remains controversial and at times somewhat contradictory. We have recently formed a consortium for Planning Research in Inpatient Diabetes (PRIDE) with the goal of promoting clinical research in the area of management of hyperglycemia and diabetes in the hospital. In this article, we outline eight aspects of inpatient glucose management in which randomized clinical trials are needed. We refer to four as system-based issues and four as patient-based issues. We urge further progress in the science of inpatient diabetes management. We hope this call to action is supported by the American Diabetes Association, The Endocrine Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Heart Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the Society of Hospital Medicine. Appropriate federal research funding in this area will help ensure high-quality investigations, the results of which will advance the field. Future clinical trials will allow practitioners to develop optimal approaches for the management of hyperglycemia in the hospitalized patient and lessen the economic and human burden of poor glycemic control and its associated complications and comorbidities in the inpatient setting.\n\n O ver the past decade, there has been increasing interest in glycemic management of hospitalized patients. There is now broad consensus that both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients are associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality. There is less agreement, however, as to whether these associations actually reflect the effects of the quality of glucose management or are merely underlying paraphenomena of the severity of acute illness. Even more controversial is the actual potential impact of glycemic control during these hospitalizations that are often relatively brief, the specific glucose ranges that should be targeted, and the methods by which clinicians might achieve these.\n\n In the 1960s, research on the benefits of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion during acute myocardial infarction began, but this line of inquiry was not focused on glucose control per se (1). Interest in the general field of glycemic management in the inpatient setting began in the mid 1990s (2) . The next 10 years were marked by both prospective observational trials and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the majority of which seemed to indicate that \"lower is better\": hospital complications, length of stay, cost, and even mortality could be dramatically decreased in a variety of critical care settings if mean glucose concentrations were reduced, usually with intravenous insulin, toward or within the euglycemic range (3, 4) . Some results, however, seemed too good to be true, especially in the context of such short hospital stays. This skepticism led to confirmatory trials, most conducted using a multicenter design. These could not confirm the initial positive findings from single-center investigations (5-7). There was resulting confusion as to how these results might shape clinical practice. Several consensus documents have emerged, each endorsing a more moderate approach to the management of glycemia in the hospitalized patient (8) (9) (10) (11) . Notably, all have called for more research in this area so that we can better understand the impact of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on inpatient outcomes and better delineate evidencebased standards for hospital practice.\n\n To date, most investigations have been funded through local resources or industry, as agencies appear reluctant to commit financial support for research in inpatient glycemic management. However, greater efforts devoted to the study of diabetes in the hospital setting would have broad implications for our health care system (12) . In addition to funding, the nascent discipline of inpatient glucose management will benefit from standardized nomenclature, consistent and meaningful metrics, and transparent study designs and analytical methods allowing for comparison of study outcomes.\n\n In this article, we outline eight aspects of inpatient glucose management in which RCTs and/or rigorously designed observational studies are needed.

[2] [3] [4] [5] HEV is transmitted predominantly by the fecal-oral route, usually through contaminated water. 1 The clinical spectrum of HEV infections varies from asymptomatic to severe hepatitis that may lead to fulminant hepatic failure. 6 Hepatitis E occurs frequently in epidemic outbreaks and as sporadic hepatitis. 1 Hepatitis E often affects young adults and is particularly severe in pregnant women [7] [8] [9] and in persons with preexisting alcoholic liver disease. 10 Infection with HEV may also lead to extra-hepatic manifestations. 11 Hepatitis E is considered a zoonosis, 12 and HEV is pathogenic for some domestic and wild animals. 13 The seroepidemiology of HEV infection in rural pregnant women in Mexico is largely unknown. Many pregnant women in rural Mexico live in suboptimal sanitary conditions that may favor transmission of HEV including poor availability of drinkable water, poor disposal of excretes, and soil flooring and overcrowding at home. In addition, a large number of rural pregnant women have contact with a variety of animals. Infections with HEV may lead to mortality in pregnant women. 8, 9 However, the immunological status (presence of IgG anti-HEV) and correlates of HEV seropositivity in pregnant women in rural Mexico is unknown. Such information is needed to determine the magnitude of the HEV infection as a public health problem in our region and for an optimal planning of preventive measures against HEV infection. Hepatitis E is un-recognized in rural pregnant women in Mexico since there are not diagnostic tests available for HEV infection in rural practice. Therefore, we sought to determine the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies in rural pregnant women in Durango, Mexico. In addition, this study was aimed to determine socio-demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of the rural pregnant women associated with HEV seropositivity.\n\n \n\n The present study used serum samples and data from a previous study, 14 in such previous study the purpose and procedures of the survey were explained to all pregnant women. In addition, a written informed consent was obtained from all participants and from the next of kin of minor participants. This survey was approved by the ethical committees of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado in Durango City.\n\n Through a cross sectional study using serum samples from a Toxoplasma gondii serosurvey, 14 439 pregnant women living in rural areas of Durango State, Mexico were studied. Serum samples were originally used to determine the seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii in rural pregnant women and were collected from August 2007 to February 2008. All pregnant women studied attended public prenatal care clinics in 9 rural communities: (5 de mayo, Colonia Hidalgo, Guadalupe Victoria, Santa Clara, Vicente Guerrero, Canatl\u00e1n, Nuevo Ideal, Santiago Papasquiaro, and Rodeo). Inclusion criteria for voluntary participation of the women were pregnant women of any age, any month of pregnancy, and residing in rural Durango State.\n\n Socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were obtained from all pregnant women with the aid of a standardized questionnaire. Sociodemographic items included age, birth place, residence, educational and socio-economic levels, housing conditions and occupation. Housing conditions were obtained by using the Bronfman's criteria 15 and allowed us to assess crowding and sanitation. Briefly, five variables were evaluated: number of persons in the house, number of rooms in the house, material of the floor of the house (ceramic, concrete, soil), availability of drinkable water (within the house, out of the house, street), and form of elimination of excretes (flush toilet, latrine). A woman was considered as living in a crowded house when 1.6 to 3.5 persons per room live in her home. A woman was considered as living in an overcrowded house when more than 3.5 persons per room live in her home. In addition, educational level (years of education) of the head of the family was obtained.", "qa": [["51_3731157_0_1", "What are the transmission routes of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and how does it impact the clinical spectrum of infections?", "HEV is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often via contaminated water.

Multivariate analyses were conducted with the Cox proportional hazards model and the backward stepwise selection procedure. The chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and t-tests were performed to compare various parameters between different treatment groups. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n \n\n The median follow-up time for living patients was 41 months (range, 16-108). The median OS of all patients was 59 months. Median RFS, LRFS, and DMFS were 18, not reached, and 23 months, respectively. Five-year OS, RFS, LRFS, and DMFS were 48.9%, 31.6%, 66.4%, and 40.6%, respectively. A relapse after salvage treatment occurred in 41 (61.2%) patients during the follow-up period, and locoregional failure was detected in six patients (9.0%), distant metastasis in 30 patients (44.8%), and both failures in five patients (7.5%). During followup period, severe G-I complication over Grade III, associated with CRT, did not occur.\n\n The univariate analysis of the effect of prognostic factors on clinical outcome is shown in Table 2 . The presence of symptoms was a significant prognostic factor correlated with poor OS (p = 0.025), RFS (p = 0.007), LRFS (p = 0.003), and DMFS (p = 0.047). In contrast, age, gender, type of primary surgery, recurrence-free interval, recurrence history, recurrence site, pre-treatment CEA serum level, salvage treatment, chemotherapy regimen, resection margin, and radiation dose had no statistically significant effect on OS, RFS, LFS, or DMFS. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of symptoms was an independent prognostic factor predicting poor OS (p = 0.025; hazard ratio [ \n\n No statistically significant difference was found in OS (p = 0.181), RFS (p = 0.113), LRFS (p = 0.379), or DMFS (p = 0.458) when clinical outcomes were compared between the CRT with surgery and definitive CRT without surgery groups. Figure 1 shows the OS and RFS curves for each group. The prognostic factors, as described above, were stratified by the two groups and are shown in Table 3 . Significantly more patients with symptoms and an abnormal CEA level (> 5 ng/mL) received definitive CRT without surgery (p = 0.014, 0.009, respectively). The mean radiation dose was 54.6 BED 2Gy in the CRT with surgery group, and 66.5 BED 2Gy in the definitive CRT without surgery group (p < 0.001). In addition, post-operative RT dose was also different according to margins status. Patients with a positive resection margin received the higher radiation dose (mean dose, 57.5 BED2Gy) than patients with a negative resection margin (mean dose, 50.6 BED2Gy).\n\n This study assessed whether CRT with or without surgery was effective in patients with LRRC and identified DMFS. Pretreatment quality of life could be related to the clinical outcomes for many kinds of cancer and could be considered a potential prognostic factor. In other studies, symptoms related to LRRC have been reported as significant prognostic factors for a poor outcome [6, 7, 13] and such patients are considered a low possibility for radical resection [13] . Hydronephrosis presenting in two patients indicated a lower chance for obtaining a negative resection margin [16] . LRRC symptoms are a useful and readily assessable prognostic factor in the clinical setting.\n\n Another strength of the present study was that CRT was tailored to the individual risk of a residual tumor and the potential risk of a complication after an attempt at curative resection.

For interrupted time series studies, we will estimate a standardised effect size for each study by dividing the level by the slope and the standard error by the standard deviation of the preintervention slope. We will enter the effect sizes for level and slope in Review Manager 5 (Cochrane 2014) using the generic inverse variance method (Ramsay 2003) .\n\n For cluster randomised trials, we plan to conduct the analysis at the same level as the allocation using a summary measure from each cluster. However, if this appears to unnecessarily reduce the power of the study due to the number and size of the clusters, we will seek statistical advice to determine if a risk ratio or standardised mean difference with confidence intervals can be calculated to account for the cluster design based on a 'multilevel model' or another appropriate method.\n\n If important data are missing, we will contact authors to attempt to obtain the data. We will use intention-to-treat analyses by including all participants that were supposed to have received a particular intervention. If necessary, we will also perform sensitivity analyses by excluding studies with high rates of loss to follow-up.\n\n We plan to assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis visually and using the I\u00b2 and Chi\u00b2 statistics, regarding heterogeneity as substantial if the I\u00b2 statistic is greater than 60% or if there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi\u00b2 test for heterogeneity.\n\n If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and we will conduct formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry, using the metabias command in STATA. We will use the test proposed by Egger 1997, which can be implemented easily in STATA.\n\n We will undertake meta-analyses only where they are meaningful (i.e. if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense). A common way that trialists indicate when they have skewed data is by reporting medians and interquartile ranges. When we encounter this we will note that the data are skewed and consider the implication of this. Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. intervention A versus usual care and intervention B versus usual care) must be entered into the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double counting. If studies are homogeneous enough for pooling their results to be clinically meaningful, we will perform a meta-analysis using a random-effects model.

Two review authors will independently assess the certainty of the evidence (high, moderate, low or very low) using the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias).
