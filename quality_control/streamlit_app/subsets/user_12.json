It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required.

[4] In January 2006, Chinese National Health Department added HBV to National Disease Control and Prevention Plan List, indicating that HBV control was crucial for infectious diseases control in China. In general, the lack of HBV vaccinations in adults was responsible for HBV epidemic, indicating that national HBV vaccination for whole population (including infants and adults) holds greater promise for long-term treatment.

Under the coordination of the Implementation Management Office of Special Projects for Infectious diseases in the National Health Department, the administration branch consists of a nation-, province-, and county-level executive leadership team, while the technical branch includes a design engineering group, a responsible expert group, and a field executive team. The two branches link together in the project by formulating an administrative evaluation index of local administrations.

Similar results were reported in a porcine study, with ACL failure occurring at compressive loads of 1,812 N to 2,659 N. 19 In a study by Meyer et al, 21 occult microcracks at the interface between cartilage and subchondral bone caused by compression forces were consistent with ACL bone bruises found on MRI after injury. The authors hypothesized that the dominant factor leading to ACL failure is a compressive force acting on the posterior tibial slope, which results in posterior displacement of the femoral condyle on the tibial plateau. These compressive forces result primarily from inadequate absorption of ground reaction forces (GRFs) by the lower leg; however, both quadriceps and hamstring contraction can contribute to the compressive force, as well.\n\n Several authors have demonstrated that an axial weight-bearing compressive force combined with increased tibial posterior slope produces an anterior tibial force in knees with an intact or deficient ACL. 22, 23 Dejour and Bonnin 23 reported a 6-mm increase in anterior tibial translation with monopodal stance for every 10\u00b0increase in tibial slope. Torzilli et al 16 reported that compressive forces resulted in an anSagittal magnetic resonance image with the knee at an angle of 5\u00b0, demonstrating the angle of the patellar tendon (solid white arrow) at its attachment to the tibial tubercle. Because the angle is low (<45\u00b0) the compressive vector (Fc) is larger than the anterior shear vector (Fas). ACL = anterior cruciate ligament, PT = patellar tendon\n\n Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: Mechanisms and Risk Factors terior force vector on the proximal tibia due to the posterior slope of the tibial plateau. Giffin et al 22 observed that anterior tibial translation increased following osteotomy to enhance the posterior tibial slope. Adding an isolated compressive force postosteotomy further increased anterior tibial placement, whereas the addition of an isolated AP load postosteotomy resulted in no further tibial anterior shift or increase in in situ forces in the cruciate ligaments.\n\n The hip, knee, ankle, and foot help absorb GRFs during normal landing and deceleration. The hip muscles assist in the absorption of reaction forces from the upper body weight, while the knee, ankle, and foot absorb the GRFs. In the ACL injury position, the joint segments of the leg are not effective in synergistically dampening GRFs in an accordionlike fashion. In particular, during noncontact ACL injury the foot lands at or near the flat-footed position, 5 with the result that the lower leg and foot act as a single segment. The position of the foot and ankle reduces the ability of the calf muscles to absorb GRFs, and the leg is converted into a two-segment column (above the knee and below the knee) that may be incapable of adequately absorbing the energy from the GRFs, 24 resulting in column buckling. to frame 5 at a rate of 30 frames per second (30 Hz) (4.1\u00b0versus 43.8\u00b0, respectively). Persons with ACL rupture reached the flatfoot position 50% sooner than did controls (average difference, 1.6 frames). This shorter time span reduces the ability of the calf muscles to contract and absorb forces, resulting in increased impulsive forces. The impulse force is directly related to change in velocity and inversely related to the time required for the change. Assuming that injured and control athletes experience the same change in velocity, then the shorter stopping time for the injured athletes results in a higher impulsive force. A head-on car accident provides an analogous situation. The crumple zone of a car and a deployed airbag serve to slow the time of impact, resulting in lower forces on the driver. Likewise, the gastrocnemius-soleus complex slows the speed with which the GRFs travel to the knee. The abnormal mechanics measured on videotapes of injured athletes 5 imply that the calf muscles do not have sufficient time to absorb the GRFs. This results in transmission of the GRFs to the knee, which increases the compressive or impulse force. Thus, the plantarflexed ankle in the safe position protects the ACL by giving the forces more time to dissipate. Maximum peak vertical GRFs experienced by one-leg landings after jumping maneuvers have been estimated to range from 2 to 18 times body weight.", "qa": [["11_3214444_1_1", "How do compressive forces contribute to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) failure?\n", "Compressive forces play a significant role in ACL failure by causing posterior displacement of the femoral condyle on the tibial plateau.

Risk factors for hyperglycemia included age over 10 years, Down syndrome, obesity, and a family history of diabetes mellitus. The frequency of hyperglycemia increases when there is >1 risk factor. 1 Pui et al observed hyperglycemia during remission induction in 41 (9.7%) of 421 pediatric patients who received the combination of prednisone and asparaginase for ALL. 4 In 39 of the 41 patients, hyperglycemia developed within a week of the first dose of asparaginase. Koltin et al 5 observed a 15.7% incidence of medication-induced diabetes in patients with ALL. They confirmed the previously described association with age >10 years and Down syndrome. They also noted an increased risk with central nervous system involvement at diagnosis. In contradistinction to earlier reports, they did not find any association with body mass index. In multivariate analysis, age >10 years and central nervous system involvement were significantly associated with medication-induced diabetes.\n\n Transient hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy for ALL is even more frequent, affecting up to 20% of patients, as reported by Lowas and colleagues. 6, 7 Overt hyperglycemia during ALL induction has been associated with decreased relapse-free survival and overall survival. 8 Traditionally, insulin therapy had been used for treatment of symptomatic hyperglycemia in patients with ALL. Insulin requires subcutaneous administration and frequent monitoring of the blood glucose level to prevent hypoglycemia. Subcutaneous injections and finger pricks for glucose monitoring required with insulin therapy may add more discomfort and stress to the child and family.\n\n Metformin, an oral antidiabetic agent is not associated with hypoglycemia, a known concern with insulin. In addition, metformin has many interesting off-target effects that may be beneficial to patients with malignancies. A number of studies have shown a lower incidence of malignancy in diabetic patients treated with prolonged metformin. 9 Diabetic breast cancer patients on metformin show an increased pathologic complete response after 21 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy than diabetic breast cancer patients not on metformin. 10 This may be due to the inhibition of AMPK by metformin and its downstream targets such as mTOR or AKT. 11 Targeting mTOR has shown benefit in childhood ALL. 12 In addition, metformin may protect patients from anthracycline cardiotoxicity. 13, 14 The anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin are frequently given in conjunction with corticosteroids and asparaginase. Thus, patients may be placed on metformin therapy for hyperglycemia at the time they are receiving cardiotoxic anthracyclines. The role of oral antidiabetics in adults with steroid-induced diabetes is felt to be limited because of slow action and a potential for side effects. 15 A comprehensive literature review did not reveal any reports on the use of metformin or other oral antidiabetic agents in pediatric patients with cancer or for medication-induced diabetes in children or adults with leukemia or lymphoma.\n\n \n\n Patients with ALL who developed hyperglycemia from corticosteroids with or without asparaginase and received metformin with or without insulin were identified from the electronic medical record data warehouse and pharmacy database.\n\n Glucose levels were monitored periodically while patients were on corticosteroid courses lasting longer than 7 days, which typically occurs during remission induction or relapse reinduction.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), appears to play a key role in mediating neuronal cell survival and neuroprotection. 30 Orike et al 11 demonstrated that the survival of adult sympathetic neurons in the absence of neurotrophic factors depends on PI 3-kinase/Akt signalling. Several studies showed that PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway plays a major role in mediating the survival response of retinal ganglion cells after axotomy to a variety of growth factors. [12] [13] [14] In addition, apoptosis of retinal neurons induced by serum deprivation was reduced by insulin via activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. 15 Furthermore, retinal PI 3-kinase/Akt signalling pathway was activated by optic nerve clamping and had a neuroprotective effect on injured retinal ganglion cells. 16 In agreement with our results, immunoreactivity for phosphorylated Akt was detected in retinal ganglion cells in the injured retina. 16 Cox enzymes mediate the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Two Cox isoforms Cox-1 and Cox-2 have been identified. Cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is believed to be responsible for maintenance levels of prostaglandins for various housekeeping functions. In contrast, Cox-2 is the product of an immediate early gene that is rapidly inducible and tightly regulated. Cox-2 expression can be induced in various tissues by pathologic stimuli, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and tumour promoters. Even though it is called the inducible isoform, Cox-2 is constitutively expressed in brain, spinal cord, testis, tracheal epithelia, and macula densa of kidney. In these tissues, Cox-2 is present without obvious stimulatory processes and is considered to be the dominating Cox isoform. Cox-2 has been shown to contribute constitutively to the physiologic regulation and development in these highly differentiated organ systems. 17 Recent data showed that Cox-2 and the prostaglandins resulting from its enzymatic activation are involved in the control of cellular growth, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and development of neoplasia. Selective Cox-2 inhibitor attenuated the retinal angiogenesis that accompanies retinopathy of prematurity, and normal retinal development. 31 These findings indicate that Cox-2 plays an important role in both developmental and pathologic retinal angiogenesis.

No treatment or a delayed treatment of ALI may result in limb amputation. ALI is much more frequent in the lower limbs, being a result of arteriosclerotic lesions. Other causes of lower limb acute ischaemia include an injury or a complication of a vascular procedure [1] [2] [3] . A more developed collateral circulation in the upper limbs results in a lower number of acute ischaemia incidents in this anatomical region. Such incidents are mostly due to a thromboembolic mechanism or an injury. Their symptoms are less intense than in the case of lower limb ischaemia [4, 5] .\n\n A method of growing diagnostic importance in cases of upper limb ischaemia is the computed tomography angiography (CTA), especially since the introduction of multislice (CT) units that allowed for scanning of long body parts, with acquisition of high-resolution images and a very good contrast enhancement of the vessels.\n\n In this work, we reported 3 cases of acute posttraumatic ischaemia of the upper limbs, diagnosed in the emergency setting with the use of the 64-slice CT scanner.\n\n \n\n Patient J.O., aged 46, was admitted to the emergency surgical department due to an acute ischaemic incident affecting the right upper limb and caused by the crush of the right elbow joint with an agricultural machine.

Forearm arteries were not opacified. An emergency reconstruction of the brachial artery was performed -a fragment of the saphenous vein was sewed in. The patient was subjected to intraoperative consultation by a hand surgery specialist, who recommended fasciotomy.

This is mainly achieved by vacuum therapy, which is offered by both, VAC-IPOM and VAWCM and thereby potentially explains the comparable in-hospital mortality.\n\n To reduce short-term complications, the integrity of the abdominal wall should be restored as soon as hemodynamic stabilization and removal of septic foci have been achieved. Repetitive abdominal dressings in this setting as required by VAWCM are potentially unnecessary or even harmful leading to a marked increase in duration of stay on ICU.\n\n The fascial closure rate of the current series with VAWCM was similar to a previously published metaanalysis, i.e., 73.1% [3] . However, the fasciae of 25.8% of patients using the VAWCM technique were not closed and a planned ventral hernia was the consequence, which could be prevented by the VAC-IPOM technique. In the VAC-IPOM group, fascial closure was not required in the majority of patients because this technique was sufficient to stabilize the abdominal wall and prevented excessive fascial traction. Therefore, high tension to achieve fascial closure can be avoided.\n\n Intestinal fistula is a putative complication in patients with OA and might potentially further complicate the clinical course [16] . The current series supports a growing body of literature showing that the incidence of enterocutaneous fistula in the contaminated abdomen is not different when compared to a cohort without synthetic, intraperitoneal mesh implantation [8, 9, [17] [18] [19] . Visceral protection with dual-layered meshes seems to be a key element in prevention of mesh-related intestinal fistula in these patients [20] . Because of this additional barrier function, the VAC-IPOM technique also allows bedside subcutaneous VAC treatment, avoiding unnecessary re-operations.\n\n The frequency of SSI in this population is high and may be complicated by chronic mesh infection [21] . Even though mesh removal is a putative complication for chronic SSI (especially in patients with peritonitis), mesh explantation is rarely necessary [22] .\n\n At long-term follow-up, incisional hernia is the most important complication in patients after OA [23, 24] . Even in a series of patients with a very high fascial closure rate of 88%, the rate of incisional hernias remained high with an incidence of at least 28.6% [25] . These high incidences of incisional hernia and the fact that the collagen structure is comprised in these patients (Fig. SDC 2) indicates the importance of a reinforcement of the abdominal wall. Biologic meshes are an option for the treatment of abdominal wall defects in contaminated fields [26] . However, a recent meta-analysis revealed that biologic meshes were associated with more surgical site complications and hernia recurrence compared to synthetic meshes [27] . Therefore, usage of biologic meshes for such situations should be critically reevaluated [28] .\n\n Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and the fact that two different centres were compared with differences in health care. The fact that both hospitals treat a similar number of patients using a comparable surgical spectrum, confounding biases should be reduced. Essentially, prior to data collection, outcome parameters were pre-defined to overcome different definitions. Additionally, the most relevant outcome parameters (Mortality, intestinal fistula, fascial closure, hernia) did not differ compared to other published series [3] . Of note, the current series almost exclusively consists of non-trauma patients.\n\n In the current study, VAC-IPOM in patients with OA decreased re-operations, duration of hospital and ICU stay, and the incidence of incisional hernia compared to VAWCM.

In contrast to the apparent therapeutic effect of \u2424 2 ARs, \u2424 1 AR overexpression in the hearts of transgenic mice, even at low levels, leads to progressive early cardiomyopathy and HF. 7 Treatment of patients with end-stage HF involves different modalities, including mechanical support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and cardiac transplantation. Recently, significant improvement in ventricular function has been reported in some patients assisted with a mechanical pump, and surprisingly, successful weaning from the LVAD was occasionally possible. 8 -12 Little is known regarding the mechanisms that might predict this functional recovery, 10 although contractile response to \u2424AR stimulation improved in samples obtained from human ventricles unloaded with an LVAD. 13, 14 Therefore, a better understanding of the \"reverse remodeling\" process, ie, the mechanisms involved in such functional recovery during ventricular unloading, may lead to new molecular approaches that could provide novel hemodynamic support strategies to favor myocardial recovery and potentially successful weaning from LVADs without orthotopic transplantation.\n\n In the present study, we wanted to determine whether heterotopic transplantation of failing rabbit hearts could represent a model of LV unloading and support functional recovery. Moreover, because \u2424AR stimulation is the most powerful means of enhancing ventricular contractility, we investigated the potential benefit of combining genetic augmentation of \u2424 2 AR signaling and ventricular unloading for the reverse remodeling process.\n\n \n\n We used a first-generation E1/E3-deleted replication-deficient serotype 5 adenovirus as previously described. 5, 15 The \u2424 2 AR transgene (Adv-\u2424 2 AR) and the marker transgene \u2424-galactosidase (Adv-\u2424Gal) were driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Virus was thawed and mixed with PBS to a final volume of 2 mL immediately before use.\n\n Adult male New Zealand White rabbits (3 kg) were used, and all procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University. A myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by a ligation of the first marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery as previously described. 16, 17 The control group included sham-operated animals in which only a thoracotomy and pericardiotomy were performed.\n\n Four weeks after left circumflex coronary artery ligation, donor animals were anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.0 mg/kg) and ventilated. The hearts were exposed via a clam-shell thoracic incision. HF was confirmed by global dilation of the heart, the presence of pleural effusion and/or ascites, and the presence of a large infarcted area estimated to be \u054630% of the LV free wall. The donor hearts were then arrested by intracoronary perfusion with 30 mL of University of Wisconsin cold cardioplegic solution and quickly harvested and maintained at 4\u00b0C as described. 18, 19 Explanted hearts were randomized to receive either adenovirus or PBS. The hearts were then transplanted into the neck of recipient rabbits as described. 18 Total ischemic time was \u03f745 minutes. The hearts resumed vigorous contraction within 3 minutes of reperfusion. Dexamethasone (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously before reperfusion and then intramuscularly on a daily basis. In a subgroup, an LV biopsy was taken from the donor heart for biochemical comparison with paired samples obtained 5 days after unloading.\n\n In another subgroup of experiments, we positioned an LV latex balloon into the left atrium connected to tubing conducted under the skin to the subscapular region.", "qa": [["36_19332594_0_1", "What are the alterations that occur in the \u2424-adrenergic receptor system during the progression of heart failure?\n", "During the progression of heart failure, alterations occur in the \u2424-adrenergic receptor (\u2424AR) system.

This diagnosis concerns 10-15% of all pregnancies [1, 2] and is made based on additional tests such as serial determinations of chorionic gonadotrophin concentration and imaging examinations -ultrasonography [1] [2] [3] . Depending on the clinical presentation and results of ultrasonography, miscarriages can be divided into complete spontaneous miscarriage, and incomplete miscarriage, when the width of the echo of residual tissues in the uterine cavity exceeds 10 mm on ultrasonography and is accompanied by the presence of clinical symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain [4] . The other type of miscarriage is defined as retained products of conception (RPOC) and refers to the state when the gestational sac contains the embryo with crown-rump length (CRL) of > 7 mm but embryonic cardiac activity is invisible [3] . Empty gestational sac is diagnosed when the gestational sac with a diameter of > 25 mm and without an embryo is visible in the uterine cavity on ultrasonography [3] .\n\n When miscarriage is diagnosed, therapeutic decisions are made depending on the type of miscarriage, the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as well as patient choice; the patient is informed about possible therapeutic options together with the advantages and disadvantages of each option [5] [6] [7] [8] . Historically, a diagnosis of miscarriage resulted in immediate curettage of the uterine cavity in order to avoid complications associated with gestational tissues remaining in the uterine cavity such as hemorrhage, local or generalized infection, and proliferation of trophoblastic tissue leading to gestational trophoblastic disease [5, 6] . In the literature, two methods of treatment are described. The first method is the classic approach based on curettage of the uterine cavity. It allows for the removal of gestational tissues from the uterine cavity and the direct collection of specimens for histopathological examination. The second one is based on pharmacological treatment with cytostatics, analogues of prostaglandins and/or selective estrogen receptor modulators [6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] .\n\n The legitimacy of routine histopathological assessment of uterine products of miscarriage is currently under debate [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Some authors opt for routine histopathological examination of gestational tissues as a necessary supplement to the miscarriage therapy because it enables treatment maintenance in the case of a proliferative pathology of the trophoblast [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . An additional argument for histopathological examination is the possibility to obtain guidance on the necessity of further tests (e.g., genetic tests) and help make the final diagnosis in cases with pregnancy of unknown location [15] [16] [17] [18] . Other group of researchers claims that the routine histopathological examination has no justification, and recommended only in particular cases when ultrasound examination suggests features of trophoblast pathology or in patients with habitual miscarriages as well as when the results of the histopathologic examination are required for the diagnosis [7, [21] [22] [23] . According to NICE guidelines from 2014 regarding management of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, there is no evidence for the necessity of further monitoring and additional tests following miscarriage [24] . The Royal College of Pathologists recommends histopathological examination in late miscarriages, but the decision to conduct such an examination is left to the discretion of guidelines of local obstetric and gynecological associations [25] .

Above all other means of diagnosis it furnishes the most useful in tumors with calcareous or bony deposits as, for instance, in exostosis. If the neoplasm has its origin from the lamina vitra and grows toward the cranial cavity, its recognition by means of the X-ray is an easy matter. However, when exostoses originate at the base of the skull, and reach a certain size, they, too, will throw a shadow on the plate which may permit of a diagnosis being made [278]\u2026 Neoplasmata of the base of the skull are closely allied to tumors at the base of the brain. New formations originating in these cases from the outer (lower) surface of the dura or from the bone itself grow, as a rule, into the cranial cavity and may give rise to manifestations of cerebral compression as well as to morbid symptoms from involvement of the cerebral nerves. A differentiation as to the structures from which the tumor originated is, from the clinical manifestations alone, frequently impossible. (821) 17 Krause used the x-ray apparatus on every patient with epilepsy that he treated:\n\n Any injury to the skull may bring on epileptic seizures\u2026. Whenever possible x-ray examination should be made. It frequently is a great aid in clearing up the diagnosis. Even in other forms of epilepsy roentgenography is of urgent need. (479) 17 Krause stressed proper radiographic technique to avoid artifacts and inaccurate results. 3 The thought process behind Krause's efforts to acquire useful images are apparent in comments in his chapter regarding the base of the skull and the sella-sphenoid region: Interpretation of the Roentgen plate must be carefully made. The fact that the plate is of some distance from the Turkish saddle influences very largely the conformation of the shadow. Each turn of the head on its vertical axis alters the picture of the cavity, and when to this is added the fact that in acromegaly an enlargement and thickening of the skull is present, it is easy to see that an accurate picture of the contour of the base of the skull is not easily obtained. The shadow should be compared with that of the normal skull, and exposures should be made at stated intervals in order to observe the extension of the pathological process. The examination may be regarded as associated with great difficulties. (279-280) 17 By the time of publication of his text, Krause had been using x-ray images for trauma and gunshot injuries, tumor diagnosis, shunt placements and other routine cases. These images were correlated with diagnosis, associated with specific signs, symptoms, and surgical indications. Compared with contemporary neurosurgical texts, his book was unique in having clear x-ray images. Krause made it clear that by the time of his writing, his experience with x-ray applied to injuries of the skull and brain was well systematized: \"As far as injuries to the skull and brain are concerned bullets and metallic foreign bodies are easily recognized on the Roentgen plate. Their location may be determined with considerable certainty by exposures made at various levels and in several directions\" (282).\n\n \n\n Neurosurgery Monographs\n\n Meanwhile, in his acclaimed 1908 neurosurgery monograph in Keen's multivolume surgical text (Fig. 4 ), Cushing appears pessimistic about the use of x-rays. There is only one minor mention of x-rays in the cerebral tumors section: \"A radiograph may occasionally prove of value, though on the whole it is most disappointing as a diagnostic aid. It is of particular value in the recognition of basilar tumors like those of the pituitary fossa, which have led to deformation of the sella turcica or absorption of the bone\" (230). With regard to tumors of the sella turcica, Archibald thought x-rays were of good use, but he was pessimistic on the use of x-rays for tumors in other cranial locations: \"These tumors in their growth frequently enlarge the sella turcica very materially, as Oppenheim first showed, so that a good skiagram may often be of decided help. Indeed, this is perhaps the only place in which the x-rays are of service in the diagnosis of cerebral tumors\" (223). 1 Cushing was later lured back in 1912 to be chief surgeon at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston.

Finally, of the 16 cases of N. meningitidis, 50% (n \u03ed 8) reported hearing loss and 1 reported limb pain.\n\n Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and the availability of vaccines, bacterial meningitis in children is associated with a high risk of long-term sequelae. Our review showed approximately half (49.1%; n \u03ed 705/1433) of long-term survivors (specified as having a follow-up time at least 5 years) of childhood bacterial meningitis experience sequelae, of which a majority (78%) were intellectual and/or behavioral deficits. Just over 20% of survivors suffered long-term from hearing changes or neurologic deficits. This observation differs from other comprehensive literature reviews, which define \"long-term\" as occurring any time following the time of hospital discharge, which describe a much higher prevalence of neurologic and hearing deficits. 7, 9, 17, 18 For example, the literature review by Ramakrishnan et al (2009) looking at sequelae from bacterial meningitis among African children found that a median of 25% of children had 1 or more neuropsychological sequelae. 9 In the majority of reviews, the follow-up period was not defined. 7, 9, 17 By defining \"long-term\" as a follow-up period of 5 or more years, our review showed that the majority of survivors with sequelae that are documented in the literature described academic and behavioral limitations. Minor neurologic deficits have been shown often to resolve after discharge. In a large prospective study, Feigin et al (1992) found that nearly one-third (32.8%) of all children with bacterial meningitis had neurologic deficits at the time of discharge; however, 5 years later, only 11.1% had documented ongoing abnormalities. 19 In contrast, subtle neurologic deficits, such as impaired school performance, behavioral problems, and attention deficit disorder, may not be appreciated initially and may continue to affect survivors for many years.\n\n Because of the inclusion/exclusion criteria used in our analysis, several important studies related to the long-term sequelae of bacterial meningitis are not included in this review. 20 -23 Many of these authors' findings reflect similar results as what our review showed; for example, Sell et al note that 2 survivors had a 15-point IQ deficit compared with healthy sibling controls, while Sumaya et al showed that a group of 21 long-term survivors showed poor ratings in school and in employment. 22, 23 The reporting of long-term sequelae of bacterial meningitis varies widely; some authors focused on 1 specific type or category of sequelae, whereas other authors reported all sequelae. Most articles did not include a control/comparison group, which is particularly important for understanding the amount of cognitive and neuropsychological impairment that can be attributed to childhood bacterial meningitis. Some sequelae, such as joint problems, are investigated and reported with low frequency, so the true burden of those sequelae is likely underestimated. Some articles only reported on a cohort of patients who had a particular sequela, therefore not providing information on the incidence of that outcome. Information for some (n \u03ed 7) of the patients included in this analysis came from case reports, which are clearly not designed to capture the breadth of information that is available from prospective studies with larger cohorts. Finally, diagnostic methods vary widely between publications. Classification of diagnoses, for example \"severe hearing loss,\" varies widely between authors, making it difficult to quantify the magnitude of each sequela.\n\n Despite these limitations, this comprehensive review clearly demonstrates that childhood bacterial meningitis is associated with substantial long-term sequelae in survivors. As decisions are made about recommendations for use of conjugate vaccines against common etiologic agents of meningitis, the full impact of longterm sequelae should be an important consideration. Further studies from a variety of geographic and sociodemographic settings are needed to quantify the true societal and economic burden of long-term sequelae as well as fully understand the breadth of types of sequelae that survivors experience.", "qa": [["74_7105769_2_1", "What are some long-term sequelae associated with childhood bacterial meningitis?\n", "Long-term sequelae associated with childhood bacterial meningitis include cortical atrophy, headaches, sensory deficits, nystagmus, optic atrophy, optic arachnoiditis, hemianopsia, arthritis, scarring, gross neurologic sequelae, hearing deficits, low IQ/cognitive impairment, academic limitations, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral deficits, and limb pain."], ["74_7105769_2_2", "How common are long-term sequelae in survivors of childhood bacterial meningitis?\n", "Approximately 49.1% of long-term survivors of childhood bacterial meningitis experience sequelae, with the majority (78%) being intellectual and/or behavioral deficits.

In N1/N2A K/A receptors, three transitions were altered: C 3 C 2 , C 2 C 1, and C 3 C 5 , in a manner consistent with the observed decrease in intra-burst closed times. In the double mutant N1 K/A /N2A K/A receptor, we observed the combined alterations noted in the single mutants, an indication that the effects of substitutions in N1 and N2A were additive.\n\n Since there were no gross kinetic changes in the gating reaction of N1 K/M /N2A receptors, we did not expect dramatic changes in rate constants. Several rates were significantly changed relative to WT, but these were in opposing directions, and, thus, had a nearly negligible effect on the overall gating receptors. This observation is consistent with a scenario where the native interaction between lysine and asparagine residues contributes significantly to the stability of a closed N2A cleft conformation, and, in turn, a closed-cleft conformation is favorable for efficient gating. In contrast, in the K/A mutants, although the K-N interaction is also absent, a shorter side chain promotes enhanced gating presumably by allowing further cleft closure ( Table 1 ) [30] . In this scenario, a narrow N2A cleft, as in the N1/N2A K/A mutant, may accelerate activation (faster k C3C2 and k C2C1 ), whereas a less stable closed cleft, as in the N1/ N2A N/L mutant, slows activation (slower k C1O ). If, as our single-channel observations indicate, the LBD cross-cleft interactions contribute to gating, it is important to determine how these structural features influence the NMDA receptor macroscopic response. A direct evaluation of how the mutations affect the amplitude of the ensemble current is not feasible experimentally because when measuring whole-cell currents the total number of receptors varies from one cell to the next and is unknown. Instead, macroscopic measurements inform about possible changes in the time course of the ensemble response. In an attempt to test our models, we simulated macroscopic currents with long (5 s) pulses of glutamate (1 mM), and we found largely WT-like kinetics for the K/A mutants, N1 K/A /N2A and N1/N2A K/A , and a small increase in macroscopic desensitization for the N1 K/M /N2A and N1/N2A N/L receptors ( Figure 5A ). To test this prediction, we recorded whole-cell currents elicited by long (5 s) glutamate application (1 mM) and given the difference in experimental conditions (cell-attached for simulations vs. whole-cell for experiments) we observed a satisfactory concordance between model predictions and experimental measurement.\n\n Next, we used the kinetic models we developed to evaluate how the LBD cross-cleft interactions may impact responses to brief (10 ms) synaptic-like exposures to glutamate ( Figure 5B) . Relative to WT, both K/A substitutions resulted in currents with larger peaks, whereas the isosteric mutations, N1 K/M /N2A and N1/N2A N/L , produced currents with similar or lower peak levels, respectively. More significantly, the deactivation rates were slower for both K/A substituted receptors, whereas the deactivation rate was increased for N1/N2A N/L . We should note that for these simulations we assumed that the microscopic association and dissociation rates for glutamate were not affected by the mutations, and, thus, the results only reflect the changes in gating we estimated in this study. To compare these simulated traces with macroscopically recorded responses, we measured currents from N1/N2A N/L receptors (n=4) residing in outside-out patches. Small membrane patches were pulled and exposed to 10 ms pulses of 1mM glutamate in the presence of continuous 0.1 mM glycine ( Figure 5C ).", "qa": [["54_4013850_4_1", "How do the mutations in N1 and N2A receptors affect the gating process of NMDA receptors?\n", "The mutations in N1 and N2A receptors have differential effects on the gating process of NMDA receptors.

In such case where the prevalence remains high, additional phase 1A surveys would be needed at intervals of three to four years.\n\n The objective of the present survey was therefore, to assess the progress made towards the elimination of onchocerciasis in the West CDTI project by assessing unevaluated communities where the highest endemicity levels were found in 1996, before the launch of control measures. This assessment was based on previous APOC's conceptual framework for onchocerciasis elimination as it was conducted before the publication of the new 2016 WHO revised guidelines on stopping mass drug administration (MDA) and verifying elimination which advocate xenomonitoring and serology [27] .\n\n \n\n The present study was conducted in seven health districts (HD) out of the 20 of the West Region. The West Region (5\u00b030\u20320\u2033N, 10\u00b030\u20320\u2033E) is 13,892 km 2 of territory located in the central-western portion of the Republic of Cameroon. It borders the Northwest Region to the northwest, the Adamawa Region to the northeast, the Centre Region to the southeast, the Littoral Region to the southwest, and the Southwest Region to the west (Fig. 1) . The West Region is the smallest of Cameroon's ten regions in area. However, with its population estimated at 1,895,102 inhabitants in 2014 based on a census conducted by community directed distributors (CDD), it has the highest population density (136.4 inhabitants/km 2 ). Its relief is mountainous with altitude varying from as low as 500 m in the Noun and Nkam valleys to 1000-2500 m in Western High Plateau. It is a forest-savanna transition zone, irrigated by many fastflowing rivers including the tributaries of the Sanaga in the east (M\u00e9tchi\u00e9, Mifi, Nkoup, Nd\u00e9, Noun) and the tributaries of the Nkam in the south (M\u00e9noua, Makomb\u00e9, Ngoum and Mwank\u00e9) that support breeding of blackfly which transmit onchocerciasis throughout the year. The climate is equatorial of the Cameroon sub-variety in the northwestern third and equatorial of the Guinea type in the southeastern two-thirds, with a long rainy season (March-October) and a short dry season (November-February). Rainfall, moderated by the mountains, averages 1000-2000 mm per year. The West is one of the Cameroon's richest economic areas due primarily to its agricultural prosperity and the enterprising traditions of the Bamileke people, accounting for 90% of the total population.\n\n Surveyed communities were selected according to the availability of 1996 baseline data [28] and the results of the 2011 follow-up survey [29] . In 1996, a baseline survey was conducted in 38 communities belonging to six HD at that time, 30 of them being mesoendemic (35% \u2264 prevalence \u02c2 60%) or hyperendemic (prevalence \u2265 60%). Among the later, 12 communities were selected and evaluated in follow-up surveys in 2005, 2006 or 2011. From unevaluated communities, we selected 13 presenting the highest (1) .

However, according to the National Onchocerciasis Control Programme (NOCP), CDTI started in 2000 in the region with a progressive enrollment of communities [30] . So, these communities received at least 15 rounds of mass drug administration, respectively.

These two genes may serve important roles in the occurrence or development of CRC. Based on the survival analysis, alterations in PAICS exhibited no statistically significant differences in overall and progression-free survival in patients with CRC (overall survival P=0.986; progression-free survival P=0.918; Fig. 4 ). Overall survival rates were significantly different for patients with TOP2A alterations, but progression-free survival was not significantly different (overall survival P=0.002; progression-free survival P=0.703; Fig. 4 ). The expression profiles of TOP2A and PAICS in human tissues were analysed using the Oncomine database; TOP2A and PAICS mRNA was upregulated in various cancer tissues compared with normal tissues (Fig. 5A and B ). Further analysis revealed significant increases in the expression of TOP2A and PAICS in CRC ( Fig. 5C and D) .\n\n CRC is a common malignant tumour of the digestive tract, and its mortality rate (9.2%) ranks second among all types of cancer (1) . The main causes of CRC include dietary and environmental factors, as well as genetic mutations (3) . The simultaneous methylation of the CpG site and mutation of the BRAF gene are also important factors in the development and progression of CRC (11) . Failure to detect CRC early may be one of the reasons for poor prognosis in patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for efficient diagnostic and therapeutic methods.\n\n In the present study, DEGs between CRC and non-cancerous tissues were obtained from three mRNA microarray datasets. nucleotide binding and in KEGG pathways associated with the cell cycle, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and oocyte cell meiosis. A total of 10 DEGs were selected as the hub genes. Among them, TOP2A and PAICS were the top two nodes with the highest degree of connectivity. TOP2A is involved in DNA replication, transcription and chromosome segregation, and is essential for tumorigenesis and cancer development (34) . TOP2A has been demonstrated to be associated with chemoresistance and tumour recurrence and has been recognized as a target for anticancer drugs (35, 36) . In addition, TOP2A is highly expressed in lung, colon and breast cancer, involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, proliferation and chemoresistance of CRC and may be considered an important biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of tumours (37) (38) (39) . In the present study, the PPI network indicated that TOP2A interacted directly with CDK1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) and CKS2, indicating a key role for TOP2A in CRC. PAICS is involved in purine nucleotide synthesis; a previous study has demonstrated that high expression of PAICS in lung and prostate cancer is associated with an altered metabolic state of cells, apoptosis inhibition in cancer cells and enhanced cancer cell invasion (40) . In addition, PAICS has been reported to promote tumourigenesis and progression in breast and bladder cancer (41, 42) . The results of the analysis in the Oncomine database in the present study demonstrated that TOP2A and PAICS expression was significantly upregulated in CRC compared with that in normal tissues; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies focusing on the association between PAICS expression and CRC. The association between TOP2A and PAICS and overall and disease-free survival was also analysed; changes in TOP2A were significantly associated with overall survival but were independent of disease-free survival. Changes in PAICS exhibited a reduction in overall and disease-free survival; however, these observations were not statistically significant. These results may require further research for verification. CDK1 is a non-redundant cyclin-dependent kinase that serves an important role in mitosis (43, 44) . Perturbations in chromosomal stability and aspects of S phase and G2/M control mediated by CDK2 and CDK1 are pivotal tumorigenic events (45) . A previous study has demonstrated that CDK1 is required for the survival of cells overexpressing MYC, and CDK1 has a therapeutic effect in the treatment of human malignancies that overexpress MYC (46) .

Other commonly used cytogenetic features, such as gain of 6p and 8q, do not improve upon the accuracy of the DecisionDx-UM test 24 . The authors determined that a likely reason for the superiority of DecisionDx-UM test over cytogenetic methods is that the latter are static markers that are often distributed heterogeneously throughout the tumor and are thus prone to sampling error, whereas DecisionDx-UM test captures a functional \"snapshot\" of the tumor's microenvironment that does not vary as much across most tumors and is thus amenable to a single pass of a fine needle in most cases 6710 .

Initially, there was concern that an RNA-based test may not be clinically feasible due to RNA instability. However, a standard operating procedure was developed to rapidly stabilize the RNA immediately after biopsy, which eliminated RNA degradation as a major source of technical failure.\n\n In the DecisionDx-UM test, a gene is considered undetectable if its amplification product registers no Ct value after 40 cycles of quantitative PCR, and a sample is considered a technical failure if 1 or more endogenous control genes or at least 3 discriminating genes are undetectable. A large, prospective multicenter study reported high analytic sensitivity for the test, demonstrating interpretable GEP results in more than 97% of FNAB cases, a higher success rate than that of competing DNAbased tests 11181920 . This high success rate was in spite of the vast majority of samples being obtained by a single aspiration biopsy using a 25-or 27-gauge needle. A similarly high technical success rate of 97% for class assignment has been observed in a cohort of 1500 uveal melanoma samples that were run in a single CAP accredited, CLIA approved laboratory (Castle Biosciences, Inc., unpublished data).\n\n Technical concordance studies are performed for the DecisionDx-UM test at regular intervals, comparing the classification results obtained in the clinical laboratory to those from the research laboratory. With about 150 samples tested to date, there has been 100% concordance between the laboratories (Castle Biosciences, Inc., unpublished data).
