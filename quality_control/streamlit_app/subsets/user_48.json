It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

In their systematic review of the literature, Fraser and al Sayah (2011) identified that the integration of arts within health research (both as a form of knowledge production and knowledge translation) emerged with increased qualitative inquiry within the health sciences, particularly the use of theatre as a frequent arts-based dissemination strategy.

Theatrical productions based on qualitative research findings are grounded in real life scenarios, encompassing verbatim quotes and embodying recurrent themes that represent a personified and vital piece that health care professionals can empathize with (Gray, Fitch, Labrecque, & Greenberg, 2003) . These productions enable the audience to better appreciate the experience of the person that is living with the health-related condition or challenge (Gray et al., 2000; Rosenbaum, Ferguson, & Herwaldt, 2005; Shapiro & Hunt, 2003) .\n\n The use of theatre in medical and/or health education has been found to promote empathy (Dow, Leong, Anderson, & Wenzel, 2007) and compassion. Examples include \"Ed's Story\" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Wit, \" which also won the 2002 National Innovations in Medical Education Award (Deloney & Graham, 2003; Lorenz, Steckart, & Rosenfeld, 2004) . Theatre has also been used to educate health professionals about such conditions including traumatic brain injury , dementia (Kontos & Naglie, 2007; Mitchell et al., 2006) , cancers (Gray et al., 2003; Gray et al., 2000) and AIDS (Shapiro & Hunt, 2003) .\n\n Theatre as a tool for knowledge translation has received tremendous reviews from students, health care professionals, family members, patients and audiences alike Gray et al., 2000; Mitchell et al., 2006; Rosenbaum et al., 2005) .

Colantonio and colleagues (2008) argue that theatre makes an exceptional tool for education because it inspires thought on both the affective and cognitive level, enabling audiences to learn and engage through sensory stimulation as opposed to more traditional forms such as publications, lectures and conferences . Furthermore, Rosenbaum and colleagues (2005) noted that \"[\u2026] a dramatic presentation may speak more directly to students and residents who are tired and have little time to read stories\" (p.623).

The findings from the 'Balancing the Scales' study were unique insofar as they not only provide an understanding of the clients' perspective in care delivery but also how providers, despite best intentions, described the struggle to provide quality care using best evidence. The findings have implications for health professional training in order to improve relationships between health professionals and individuals living with obesity, with the goal of improving overall obesity management through IPC.\n\n Because of the richness of the data and the potential impact of the findings to influence collaborative practice, the participant narratives were translated into a script for the purpose of dramatic representation (Kirk, Price, Aston, & Vallis, 2013) .", "qa": [["7_55029781_1_1", "How does the use of theatre in medical and health education enhance practitioner skills for complex physical and social health-related conditions?\n", "The use of theatre in medical and health education has been found to be more effective than conventional teaching methods for enhancing practitioner skills for complex physical and social health-related conditions.

Due to an increased emphasis on breast screening programmes, breast cancer is now being diagnosed in its earlier stages. This has led to more surgical options, specifically those that target better cosmetic outcomes. Currently, the two main forms of breast cancer surgery are mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS). BCS was introduced as an alternative to mastectomy in patients with lower stage cancers, as it is less aggressive and could offer better cosmetic outcomes with similar benefits as compared to mastectomy. Numerous studies have been done to compare the survival outcomes between the two surgical techniques [2] [3] [4] , as well as the impact on psychological health such as depression [5] . Due to better survival outcomes for breast cancer patients over the past decades [6] , an aspect that is becoming increasingly important is the quality of life (QoL) of these patients after surgery. QoL is defined by the World Health Organisation as \"an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" [7] . Being a broad-ranging concept, QoL covers areas other than psychological health, such as physical health, personal beliefs and social relationships, and hence may be a more holistic representation of a patient. To evaluate QoL in cancer patients, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) was developed [8] . Specifically of interest in this paper is the breast cancer module (QLQ-BR23), which assesses outcomes such as body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective, systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms and upset with hair loss. The QLQ-BR23 has been validated in multiple countries as well as field-tested in cross-cultural studies [9] [10] [11] . Hence, the aim of this paper is to carry out a meta-analysis of current literature to compare postoperative outcomes in quality of life in breast cancer patients who underwent total mastectomy versus BCS, based on the EORTC QLQ-BR23.\n\n \n\n We conducted a literature search using the following databases: PubMed and EMBASE for English-language studies that were published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. Keywords included \"breast carcinoma\" OR \"breast cancer\" AND \"quality of life\" OR \"EORTC\" AND \"mastectomy\" AND \"breast conserving surgery\".\n\n Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) observational clinical study; (2) focusing on postsurgery female breast cancer patients; (3) comparing quality of life between mastectomy and BCS using EORTC QLQ-BR23; (4) presenting empirical findings on the parameters of interest (mean, standard deviation, sample size). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) quality of life was assessed using tools other than EORTC QLQ-BR23; (2) parameters of interest were not included in the findings; (3) breast reconstruction was done.\n\n Study selection was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [12] . Results from the database search were then downloaded into EndNote X9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for deduplication both electronically and manually. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to remove ineligible articles through title and abstract screening, the full texts of eligible articles were retrieved and subjected to a full review. Data extracted from the final pool of eligible articles were documented on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to include the following information: (1) first author's last name, year of publication and country; (2) total sample size; (3) mean age of patients (including standard deviation and range where available); (4) mean time from surgery to survey (including range where available); (5) mean score and standard deviation for each of the eight measurable outcomes of QoL, and sample size in the mastectomy and BCS groups.\n\n Statistical analyses were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.0 programme (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).

The epithelial cells of the jejunum are highly dependent on GSH to detoxify peroxidized lipids and reactive electrophils in the mucosal epithelium (Samiec et al., 2000) . Glutathione (GSH) deficiency leads to increase susceptibility to oxidative injury and exacerbate degeneration of the epithelial cells of the jejunum (Martensson et al., 1990) . This epithelial damage results in translocation of luminal content to the inner layers of the intestinal wall with disruption of normal intestinal function and permeability (Bischoff et al., 2014) .\n\n Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a biomarker for Lipid peroxidation which in turn is a valuable indicator of oxidative damage of cellular components. Most components of cellular structure and function are likely to be potential targets of oxidative damage, and the most susceptible substrates for autoxidation are polyunsaturated fatty acids of the cell membrane, which undergo rapid peroxidation.

(2007) stated that propolis alone cause decrease in the MDA level, as it can hinder membrane lipid peroxidation and free radical formation. This may explain our findings that MDA levels in CPF+propolis group was not significantly different from those of control group.\n\n Moreover, Cetin et al. (2012) and Yang et al. (2014) reported that propolis can inhibit microorganism growth and promote immune-stimulation with increased levels of serum IgG and IgM humoral immunity, elicit high antibody titer, elicit high and persistent mucosal immunity and enhance cellular response.\n\n However, the partial improvement of biochemical and histopathological findings in CPF+propolis group when compared with control and chlorpyrifos group may be attributed to that CPF induced the toxic effect on jejunum not only due to oxidative stress but also may be due to its blocking effect on muscrinic receptors in gut and hindering acetylcholine protective effect on barrier or due to direct cell membrane damage.", "qa": [["49_91683273_4_1", "How does chlorpyrifos (CPF) treatment affect the antioxidant defense system in different tissues?", "Chlorpyrifos (CPF) treatment directly impairs endogenous antioxidants like reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, leading to the development of oxidative stress in different tissues.

The risk of local or systemic recurrence is usually based on data obtained from prostate needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. The Gleason grading system is one of the most important prognostic factors. [1] [2] [3] In 1966, DF Gleason created a grading system for PCa based on tumor architectural patterns. 4 Dr. Gleason recognized the heterogeneity of PCa by assigning two grades to the two most common architectural patterns, reported as the Gleason score (GS). 4 Dr. Gleason reported that the presence of more than two architectural patterns was quite rare to allow for an accurate evaluation of the prognostic role of the third most prevalent pattern (i.e., the tertiary pattern). 5 The management of PCa has changed since the original system was proposed. In particular, patients in the 1960s and 1970s were not treated with RP because they presented with advanced disease and because of the greater morbidity associated with surgery; therefore, grading of RPs with multiple tumor foci and tertiary patterns was not fully investigated by Dr. Gleason. With the PSA screening and 18-gauge needle biopsies, pathologists faced new issues, such as how to report multiple cores with PCa of different GSs and how to grade small amounts of PCa. Pathologists needed guidance for applying the grade to newly described histological patterns and variants of PCa, and modifications of the original Gleason system were needed to reflect the modern practice. The Gleason grading system has undergone changes as a result of two International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) consensus conferences held in 2005 and 2014. 4, 6 INVITED REVIEW Contemporary grading of prostate cancer: 2017 update for pathologists and clinicians with a GS 6 based on the original Gleason system. 16 The concordance between biopsy and RP grades has also improved. [17] [18] [19] A further modification to the grading system in 2005 with regard to needle biopsy was that for high-grade tumors, the lower grade or pattern should not be included in the GS if it is <5% of the tumor. In needle biopsy findings with three distinct patterns, the most prevalent pattern is combined with the highest grade to form the GS, thus discarding to the second most common pattern. 4 Grading is based on the \"first plus the worst, \" that is, the most prevalent pattern plus the highest grade, such that if patterns 3, 4, and 5 are present in that order of prevalence, the grade is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\n A recommendation from the 2014 consensus conference was that the percentage of pattern 4 is recorded in all GS 7 (3 + 4, 4 + 3) tumors. 6, 20 This further stratifies GS 7 and allows for identification of tumors with a limited (i.e., \u226410%) or extensive (i.e., >75%) amount of pattern 4. 21 The practical value is that selected patients with GS 7 (3 + 4) and a small amount of pattern 4 (such as \u226410%) may be still enrolled in active surveillance programs. \n\n A novel grading system for PCa was adopted in 2014 to address some of the above limitations, which included five distinct Grade Groups (GGs), from 1 to 5 ( Table 1) . 28 The clinical importance of the GGs has been shown in clinical studies ( Table 2) . 28, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] However, it has been suggested that the GG system should be used in parallel with the 2014 Gleason grading system. 44, 45 Genomics and grade group A genomic study using whole exome and genome sequencing data from 426 localized PCas treated by RP supports the clinical significance of the prognostic GGs. 46 This study showed an increase in the frequency of both genomic deletions and amplifications associated with an increasing risk strata and of nonsynonymous point mutations.\n\n Low-risk GG 1 tumors were haploid, whereas GG 2-5 tumors showed an increasing frequency of polyploidy. Distinct genomic profiles among the five GGs were seen with Principal Component Analysis, giving support to GG 1 through GG 3 being distinct categories; however, there is genomic similarity between GG 4 and GG 5.\n\n Excellent prognosis for GG 1 PCa with GS 6 is not considered to be a lethal cancer, even though tumor progression and/or lymph node deposits have been documented in a small number of patients.", "qa": [["70_33566809_0_1", "What are the key factors used in the Gleason grading system for prostate cancer?\n", "The Gleason grading system for prostate cancer is based on tumor architectural patterns.

[2] [3] [4] Scholars have explained how continued weight loss influences the body's lean mass, reducing its energy expenditure and triggering hormone mechanisms that alter appetite. This process consists of a sequence of physiological alterations that promote adverse behaviour in weight loss maintenance. [5] [6] [7] [8] Sciamanna et al. 9 suggested that people who achieve initial weight loss and those who consistently maintain weight loss exhibit different clusters of behaviour. People who engage in consistent physical activity or who choose low-fat protein were more likely to achieve weight loss maintenance but not necessarily weight loss. On the contrary, people who participate in a variety of exercises or earlier planning of meals were more likely to achieve weight loss but not weight loss maintenance. Therefore, the key component to maintaining weight loss is the establishment of self-management, which transforms weight maintenance into autonomic and habitual behaviour. 8 Electronic self-monitoring has been applied to improve the consistency of dietary changes made during the weight loss process. [10] [11] [12] The benefits of such monitoring outweigh the inconvenience of using paper-based selfmonitoring because an electronic dietary recording system could be easily accessed by the users with mobile devices or handheld tablet computers. With the current highly connected infrastructure of wireless technology, users can record their diet using their smartphones, which are directly connected to the web-based system. The input of dietary records can occur from anywhere and at anytime. It is more common for people to bring smartphones and tablets with them than to bring a pen and pencil during daily activities; a web-based dietary recording system thus fosters higher accessibility for users. In addition, various forms of support can be tailored to reinforce the motivation required to achieve changes in eating behaviour and to provide the user with instantaneous, individual feedback. Such electronic self-monitoring and feedback facilitate transforming temporary eating behaviour into permanent eating habits. 13 Chung et al. 14 defined individual feedback as behavioural feedback. This refers to an individual's previous eating behaviour as recorded and evaluated by experts, as well as to feedback to the individual that can inform them to adjust their present eating behaviour accordingly. Behavioural feedback enables people to establish an adaptive cycle of eating behaviour by adjusting their eating behaviour progressively, thereby reducing the difficulty of adopting healthy food choices and proper portion sizes in a short period of time. Eating habits are not modified through counselling sessions or seminar-led nutrition education; 15, 16 instead, people must correct their behaviour based on repeated trial and error.\n\n Applications of electronic dietary monitoring in teledietetics are migrating from the stage of clinical trials to community practices due to the benefits of convenience and cost-effectiveness in weight reduction maintenance. 17 However, the innovative application of teledietetics still lacks theoretical support; therefore, this study aimed to examine the evidence relating to behavioural feedback in weight loss and weight loss maintenance by applying teledietetics.\n\n The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is commonly employed to explain and predict human health behaviour. 18, 19 Its central principle addresses the intention of a person to engage in a particular behaviour and suggests that several salient beliefs be treated as determinants of this intention. Attitude, subjective feelings regarding social norms, and perceived behavioural control (PBC) are the three immediate beliefs that facilitate or hinder the attainment of behaviour. The TPB has provided extensive explanations of beliefs in behavioural outcome evaluations and other behaviour-influencing beliefs. In addition, it is valuable to understand the normative beliefs and motivation to comply of people who experience the perceived social pressure to perform a target behaviour. Finally, control beliefs and perceived barriers can be attributed to the extent to which people perceive themselves as being able to perform a behaviour easily.\n\n Although the TPB has been applied extensively to health behaviour topics such as human immunodeficiency virus protection, human papillomavirus vaccination, smoking cessation and fruit and vegetable consumption, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] its use in explaining weight loss and weight loss maintenance has been limited. [25] [26] [27] [28] To assess the applicability of the TPB in measuring the intention to lose weight, this study evaluated whether the aforementioned three salient beliefs (attitude, subjective norms, and PBC) explain weight loss behaviour. In addition, this study examined the role of PBC in relation to weight loss and weight loss maintenance. In response to the rising trend of electronic self-monitoring applications, instant-learning objects such as online reports could be built in such applications. Gradually, this learning process enabled the participants to change their eating habits. The feedback from previous reports initiated reflective learning among the participants that they then applied every time they decided what and how much to eat.", "qa": [["30_36193391_0_1", "How does sustained weight loss affect the body's lean mass and energy expenditure?\n", "Sustained weight loss can lead to a reduction in the body's lean mass, which in turn decreases its energy expenditure.

Spanish-speaking patients had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for fewer years than ES patients (8.2 and 11.2 years, respectively; P=.01). Spanishspeaking patients were less likely to understand their prescriptions; 22% of SS patients reported no comprehension vs 3% of ES patients (P = .001). There was a trend toward decreased prevalence of insulin use among SS patients compared with ES patients (30% vs 42%, respectively; P=.07).\n\n Conclusions: Glycemic control in Hispanic patients was not related to their ability to speak English. This finding may be explained by a high degree of language concordance between patients and providers. Med. 2001; 161:77-82 T HE ROLE that English fluency and proficiency play in the health care of Hispanic patients with diabetes mellitus in the United States is not completely understood. Language barriers to care may have important health and medical economic implications since Hispanic individuals compose the fastest growing minority group in the United States, 1 and Hispanic individuals have higher rates of mortality due to diabetes mellitus and complications, such as peripheral vascular disease, amputations, and end-stage renal disease, than whites. [2] [3] [4] Spanish-speaking (SS) adults are more likely to be older, to live in urban areas, to be less well educated, to be unemployed, to lack medical insurance, to report poorer health status, and to score lower on measures of self-determination than English-speaking (ES) adults. 5, 6 Selfdetermination is a construct that refers to individuals' perception of the degree to which their behavior is responsible for their health. Schur et al 5, 6 measured selfdetermination using several health belief statements rated by patients according to how strongly they agreed or disagreed with each. For example, SS patients were more likely than ES patients to attribute a large role in the recovery from an illness to luck. Studies 7, 8 have shown that SS Hispanic patients are less likely than ES Hispanic patients to have a regular source of medical care, to undergo screening, to use preventive services, and/or to be referred to a specialist. In other studies, 5,9 SS was not significantly associated with limited access to health care services after controlling for socioeconomic and cultural factors known to decrease use of health care services. Language acculturation that is, learning to speak English, among Hispanic individuals has been found to predict use of preventive screening in some studies. 10, 11 Although the negative impact of the inability to speak English fluently on access to health care has been fairly well characterized, its impact on other aspects of health care has received less scrutiny. For patients who are able to successfully surmount barriers to access, language concordance, namely the patient's and provider's ability to speak the same language, may still affect both the process of care and patients' perceptions of their health status. A study 12 on language concordance suggested that patients' adherence to their health care plan and appointment-keeping behavior, 2 markers of effectiveness of medical care, were associated with the ability of medical care providers to speak the same language as their patients. Spanishspeaking patients with SS providers had better recall of recommendations made during a visit and asked more questions. 13 Patients reported significantly better health status when their provider spoke the same language as they did.\n\n \n\n 14 The role language concordance plays in patient satisfaction has not been extensively evaluated, and, despite the potential negative impact of language barriers on medical outcomes, there is a paucity of research in this area.\n\n We chose to use diabetes mellitus as a disease model for studying how medical care provided to Hispanic patients varies as a function of the patients' primary language because of the high prevalence and complication rates of diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic population. In addition, the value of glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) serves as a useful marker for disease management and outcomes. 15 The primary hypothesis was that glycemic control in SS patients with diabetes mellitus would be worse than it is in ES patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\n We attempted to contact 327 (82%) of the 399 patients who met the inclusion criteria. We were unable to contact 81 (25%) of these patients after 3 telephone attempts. An additional 55 patients (17%) could not be reached because of a disconnected telephone, an incorrect telephone number, or a changed address.

In both anaphylactic shock and experimental \"serum sickness\" there has been a close correlation between the removal of antigen by antibody with the formation of complexes and a fall in the titer of serum complement (5) (6) . The fall in serum complement presumably is due to the well known capacity of antigen-antibody complexes to bind complement. Whether the tissue lesions of hypersensitivity are mediated by the activation of complement by complexes or whether the binding of complement is merely an unnecessary by-product of the antigen-antibody interaction determining the development of the lesions, is unknown.\n\n The recent experiments of Osler and his coworkers (7) (8) implicate complement in the mediation of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The works of Levine (9), Lepow, Ratnoff, and Pillerner (10) , and Becket (11, 12) suggest that the first component of complement consists of a proesterase which can be activated by antigen-antibody complexes. It is conceivable that the tissue lesions of hypersensitivity might be enzymatically induced through the action of complement.\n\n A preliminary study was undertaken to determine the changes in total complement activity in the serum of animals developing accelerated \"serum sickness.\" It was found that a reduction of total complement activity in these animals almost always coincided with the time of antigen clearance. Subsequently, attempts were made to lower complement activity in the serum by the intravenous administration of heterologous immune precipitates or immune soluble complexes to determine whether a reduction in complement activity would m o d i f y t h e incidence of allergic lesions in \" s e r u m sickness.\" T h e accele r a t e d f o r m of s e r u m sickness was e m p l o y e d to lessen t h e period of i n t r a v e n o u s a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of heterologous i m m u n e complexes.\n\n Experimental Animals.--Male albino rabbits weighing 2 to 3 kg were used in all experiments. Alum-precipitated crystallized bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared as described by Kabat and Mayer (13) . Rabbits were sensitized by 8 dally intravenous injections of 4.2 ml alum-precipitated BSA containing 1 mg of protein nitrogen. They were then allowed to rest for 3 days after which they were skin-tested with 1 mg BSA protein in 0.2 ml volume. 24 hours later skin tests were read and the animals were given a 0.5 gm BSA intravenously for production of accelerated \"serum sickness.\" Most of the animals eliminated the BSA in 3 to 7 days. The day of elimination was determined by performing daily antigen capillary tests as described previously (14) . Blood samples were taken at appropriate intervals in order to determine the level of total complement activity. The animals were usually sacrificed 1 day after the antigen became negative at a time when the highest incidence of lesions would be expected (15) . The tissues were prepared for histologic study in the usual manner.\n\n Antigen-Antibody Insoluble Complexes.--BGG antiserum was obtained from a large series of rabbits receiving weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg of this antigen contained in 1 ml Freund's complete adjuvant mixture. At appropriate intervals during immunization, blood was obtained from the marginal ear vein and utilized to determine the approximate amount of circulating antibody. Animals with sera containing high concentrations of antibody were bled by cardiac puncture; the sera were pooled and stored at -15\u00b0C until used. The average antibody concentration of these pooled sera ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 mg antibody nitrogen (AbN) per ml. Immune precipitates were prepared in antibody excess. The antigen and antiserum were mixed at room temperature and allowed to stand at 37 \u00b0 for 30 minutes and at 3\u00b0C overnight. The resulting precipitate was washed once with cold saline, finely dispersed by use of the Waring blender, and suspended in isotonic saline so that an aliquot of precipitate containing 20 mg of AbN occupied a volume of 50 ml.\n\n Antigen-Antibody Soluble Complexes.--Immune soluble complexes were prepared by mixing bovine plasma gamma globulin and rabbit anti-bovine plasma gamma globulin at equivalence.", "qa": [["83_20395278_0_1", "How does the decrease in serum complement levels during anaphylactic shock and serum sickness type hypersensitivity affect the development of tissue lesions?\n", "The decrease in serum complement levels during anaphylactic shock and serum sickness type hypersensitivity is believed to be due to the binding of complement by antigen-antibody complexes.

In fact, one of the most common problems after bariatric surgery is insufficient weight loss, especially in super-obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 50 m 2 /kg) (2) . The most efficacious bariatric procedure with regard to weight loss is biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS). DS was introduced by Hess and Hess (3) and Marceau et al. (4) in the 1980s as an open procedure (O-DS), but is feasible through laparoscopic procedure (Lap-DS) as a one-or two-stage procedure (5, 6) . In bariatric patients, laparoscopy has specific advantages, both regarding pulmonary function and decreased risk of incisional hernias (7) . However, all surgery in superobese patients is technically demanding and comes with specific risks. For example, previous reports on DS surgery have described considerable mortality, 0.6%-7.6% (8) (9) (10) . This in combination with the perceived high technical demands might explain why DS is only performed in 2% of all bariatric cases worldwide (11) . The increased risk of developing nutritional deficiencies after DS compared to other bariatric procedures adds complexity and requires patient selection and careful postoperative follow-up.\n\n Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) is a nationwide quality registry covering 98% of all bariatric surgery performed in Sweden since 2007. SOReg contains more than 50,000 procedures, of which less than 1% is DS. Data are entered prospectively: at baseline, perioperatively, and during follow-up, with less than 2% missing values. The accuracy of the variables used in this study is high (12) . In addition, the operative techniques used for Lap-DS and O-DS, respectively, at different centers are very similar, because of a national training program.\n\n The aim of this study was to compare Lap-DS with O-DS on a nationwide basis with regard to perioperative outcome and postoperative complications within 30 days.\n\n Between 2007 and 2014, 317 DS procedures, performed at six centers, were registered in SOReg. Patients undergoing Lap-DS were younger than those having O-DS (34.8 \u00b1 11.2 vs 39.1 \u00b1 9.9 years), as shown in Table 1 . no differences were found between the groups regarding BMI, smoking status, hypertension, or diabetes preoperatively; however, sleep apnea was less common among Lap-DS patients (8% vs 28%). Diabetes was defined as elevated fasting blood glucose level or ongoing treatment with anti-diabetic drugs. Sleep apnea was defined as sleep apnea requiring treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. The proportion of male patients was found to be high, 38% and 44% in Lap-DS and O-DS, respectively. The number of O-DS procedures was evenly distributed during the study period while Lap-DS was concentrated in the latter half of the study period, 46 out of 53 Lap-DS cases (87%) were registered from 2011 to 2014.\n\n The Lap-DS performed is a 5-6 trocar procedure. The vertical sleeve gastrectomy is performed over a 36 French bougie and the duodenum is divided 3 cm distal to the pylorus. The ileocecal region is identified and the distal ileum measured in 10 cm steps for 100 cm. This is the location of the entero-enteric anastomosis, and it is marked with two sutures of different lengths. The alimentary limb is then measured to 150 cm and the bowel is divided 250 cm from the ileocecal valve. The remaining biliary limb is positioned in the lower part of the abdomen, close to the previously marked location of the entero-enteric anastomosis, and a linear stapled and hand-sewn side-to-side enteroanastomosis is performed. The proximal end of the alimentary limb is brought into an antecolic position and anastomosed to the duodenal bulb by a completely handsewn end-to-end duodenoileostomy. The mesenteric defects are routinely left open.\n\n O-DS has been previously described in this journal (13) and the procedure is highly standardized in Sweden.

Wenger, McDermott and Snyder (2002) (pp. 4-5) .\n\n The community of practice model proposed by Wenger (1998) and developed further for business contexts by Wenger, McDermott and Snyder (2002) provides a framework for the building of successful academic communities of practice. The essential elements of a Community of Practice are defined by Wenger (1998) as:\n\n \uf0b7 a domain of knowledge that creates a common ground and sense of common identity; \uf0b7 a community of people who care about the domain and create the social fabric of learning; and \uf0b7 a shared practice that the community develops to be effective in its domain.\n\n In this project, the domain of knowledge is focused around research supervision and the community members are USQ research supervisors. At USQ substantial progress has been made in adopting the Community of Practice concept since it was piloted in 2006 in the Faculty of Business CoP for First Year Core Course Leaders Star 2008, 2006) . The model has a number of unique features that have proven successful at USQ for implementing and sustaining CoPs in an academic context. These features include the use of the three CoP elements of community, sharing practice, and building domain knowledge which provide the organising structure for CoP meetings.\n\n This CoP structure ensures that each of the essential elements of a CoP is addressed at CoP meetings and provides clear direction, outcomes and value-adding for members. The structure, community support, and outcomes have assisted in addressing initial scepticism about 'just another meeting', and ensure best use of the time committed, for time-poor tertiary educators (McDonald and Star 2008).\n\n USQ CoPs are informed by social learning theory (Bandura 1972 ) moving the focus of learning from the individual to a cognitive process that takes place, or is situated, in a social context. Vygotsky (1978) made a major contribution to social learning theory by arguing for the importance of social relations and supporting learners to relate what they already know with what they could know, thereby influencing educational approaches and underscoring the importance of learning in a social environment. Mercieca (2016) provides an extended discussion on the social-cultural underpinning of CoPs. Mercieca notes that Vygotsky (1978) saw social relations as an important component of developing higher level thinking, and should not artificially separate intellectual and social activities: \"Rather, we should conceive of the individual and his environment as factors that mutually shape each other in a spiral process of growth\" (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 22) .\n\n The term 'Communities of Practice' emerged from research into learning at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre in California in the 1980s (Tight, 2015) , and has moved from describing organic communities to suggest approaches to create and support communities, implement intentional and strategic communities, and to view not just individual communities, but members of communities operating across a whole landscape of practice. Etienne and Bev Wenger-Trayner have moved their social learning and Community of Practice research and theory from CoPs in a specific practice field to social learning and knowledgeability across a whole landscape of practice (Wenger-Trayner et al. 2015) .\n\n The early work of Lave and Wenger (1991) that investigated the apprenticeship model of learning showed that, rather than the novice apprentice learning from the master craftsman, learning took place through a complex set of social relationships. A whole social network, including other apprentices, supported the learning journey within the particular practice field, and eventually led to recognition as a fullyfledged member of the Community, hence the term 'Community of Practice'.\n\n The Community members have valuable local knowledge and strategies to share with their colleagues. Within the CoP literature, this is highlighted by the emphasis on the practice of the participants, the sharing of tacit knowledge, and the role of apprentices, who learn the craft of their masters through observation, imitation and practice (Wenger 1998) .

Both\n\n are common colonisers of human skin, particularly the face, and occupy the pilosebaceous unit, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands. D. folliculorum is more prevalent, but D. brevis has a wider bodily distribution. 1, 2 Normal rates of colonisation have been estimated between 20% and 80%, increasing with age, and they are considered part of the normal dermatological flora of the skin. [1] [2] [3] Their potential connection to skin diseases is controversial, with many considering them to be coincidentally present in diseased skin, or to be temporarily and opportunistically parasitic in the diseased state. 2, 4 However, some evidence points to a contribution of Demodex to the pathogenesis of multiple skin disorders, including rosacea, blepharitis, and pustular folliculitis. [4] [5] [6] [7] Oily or mixed skin appears to increase the risk of Demodex infestation. 8 It is also well-known that Demodex mites are pathogenic in the context of immunosuppression. 1, 2 A potential link to acne, a disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, in humans is controversial. 4, 9 However, a recent meta-analysis of case control studies supported an association between Demodex infestation and acne vulgaris. 10 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5-10% of women of reproductive age and commonly features chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. [11] [12] [13] Hyperandrogenism is typically associated with systemic effects, including acne, hirsutism, and central obesity. In women with PCOS, acne is predominantly distributed as inflammatory lesions on the lower face, neck, chest, and upper aspect of the back. 13 Women with PCOS are also at high risk of depression and anxiety, which has a negative impact on their health-related quality of life. Acne has been identified as one of the factors potentially contributing to the risk of affective disorders and a reduced quality of life in women with PCOS. 14, 15 Given the association between PCOS and acne, as well as the proposed association of Demodex infestation with acne, we hypothesised that Demodex infestation may be more prevalent in women with PCOS and that there may be a link between Demodex and the presence of acne and/or oily skin in PCOS patients. One recent study on 30 PCOS patients and 30 matched healthy control subjects has shown that D. folliculorum infestation is increased in women with PCOS. 16 The objectives of this study were, therefore, to determine whether or not the prevalence of Demodex mites was increased in a larger group of women with PCOS and to examine the relationship between Demodex infestation and the presence of acne, as well as with oily or dry skin types in PCOS patients.\n\n The study was carried out at the Department of Obstetrics 12 The healthy control group was composed of 47 females with regular menses, normal medical history, physical and pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound, and blood chemistry. None of the PCOS or control patients had been on any medication for at least 3 months prior to the study, including oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, ovulation induction agents, or anti-diabetic and anti-obesity drugs. All subjects were examined for dermatological The data were presented as mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation (SD) and analysed using the Student's t-test to determine whether differences between PCOS and control groups and between subgroups were significant. P\u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n There was no significant difference between the PCOS and control groups in terms of BMI, weight and median age ( Table 1) .\n\n Significantly more PCOS than control patients had acne (70.7% v 42.6% respectively; p=0.01); 36 of 41 PCOS patients (87.8%), as compared to none of the control subjects complained of hirsutism (p<0.001). The rate of oily skin was similar for the two groups, at 70.7% of PCOS patients and 74.5% for controls (p=0.811); 53.7% of the PCOS group were D. folliculorum positive, while 31.9% of the control group were D.", "qa": [["28_4969719_0_1", "What are the potential skin disorders associated with Demodex infestation?\n", "Some potential skin disorders associated with Demodex infestation include rosacea, blepharitis, and pustular folliculitis.

In depressed patients, post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have identified neuronal atrophy and aberrant activity patterns in several brain structures, most notably in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (Zou et al., 2010; Drevets, 2001; Krishnan & Nestler, 2008) . Remarkably, chronic stress, an environmental risk factor known to contribute to the development depression, also affects neuroplasticity in similar brain regions. These affected structures are responsible for various aspects of cognition, including executive functions (prefrontal cortex), emotional response (amygdala) and memory formation (hippocampus). Again, the normal functions of the brain regions disrupted by chronic stress and MDD parallel the symptomatology of depression, pointing to an underlying role for dysfunctional neuronal plasticity in the etiology of MDD. A powerful facet of the neuroplastic hypothesis is the ability to explain the delayed onset of antidepressant drug effects. Through a slower-acting secondary neuroplastic mechanism, long-term adaptive changes in the brain in response to antidepressants are thought to be responsible for the clinical improvement of depressive symptoms. Indeed, following chronic antidepressant treatment, the occurrence of structural and functional changes and enhanced neurogenesis that normalize neuronal networks and activity patterns correlates with the onset of the therapeutic response, and are likely to play a causal role in antidepressant action (Ressler & Mayberg, 2007; Santarelli et al., 2003; Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008) . Though we lack a clear understanding of the mechanistic action of antidepressants, there is an apparent relationship between the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and MDD neuropathology, which has been illuminated by the molecular and cellular changes in the brain brought about by antidepressant action. The implication of neuroplasticity in MDD lends to the exciting possibility that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity may be effective and more direct targets for antidepressant therapeutics, providing prospective directions for investigation in a field of pharmacology that has been stagnant for decades.\n\n The slow onset of therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs that rapidly increase synaptic levels of monoamine neurotransmitters necessitated the development of an alternative neuromodulatory hypothesis for the mechanism of therapeutic action of antidepressant medication. However, the monoaminergic and neuroplasticity theories of depression are not mutually exclusive, as monoamines are modulatory neurotransmitters that influence neurogenesis and neuron survival, neuronal activity, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity by initiating molecular signalling cascades. In particular, changes in the expression levels or function of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that is a key regulator of synaptic plasticity and participates in a developmental feed-back loop with serotonin, has been suggested to underlie both depression neuropathology and the therapeutic antidepressant response (Martinowich & Lu, 2008) . Studies demonstrating that levels of BDNF and BDNF-mediated signalling are reduced in depressed patients and increased patients receiving antidepressant medication provide a link between the expression of BDNF and the therapeutic action of antidepressants (Shimizu et al., 2003; Chen, 2001 ). This notion is further supported by evidence that BDNF signalling is necessary for mediating the antidepressant response in animal models (Saarelainen et al., 2003) . How exactly this BDNF-mediated neuroplasticity contributes to the emotional and behavioural response in antidepressant treatment remains unidentified. The intracellular signal transduction cascades connecting serotonin neurotransmission and BDNF expression provide a workable explanation for the ability of antidepressants that potentiate monoaminergic activity to promote neuroplasticity and an antidepressant www.intechopen.com response. All but one of the 5-HT receptor subtypes act through a G-protein coupled metabotropic mechanism, which initiates cellular responses through the activation of intracellular signalling cascades.", "qa": [["84_54814754_1_1", "How does the neuroplasticity theory of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) challenge the monoamine theory of depression?\n", "The neuroplasticity theory of MDD suggests that depression is caused by disruptions in neuronal plasticity, which refers to structural and functional changes in the brain in response to environmental factors.
