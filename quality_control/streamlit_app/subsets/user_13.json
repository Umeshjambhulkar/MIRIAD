It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

Intestinal iron absorption is thus blocked (Fig. 3) . Whatever the mechanism of action of hepcidin, its absence favors intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron stored in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

In 2012, Australia ranked 22nd globally for organ donors, with 15.6 donors per million population (International Registry in Organ Donation and Transplantation). That year, we were ranked 12th in the world for gross domestic product, one measure of a nation's productive wealth (International Monetary Fund). In comparison, the gross domestic products of Spain and Croatia ranked 14th and 74th respectively, yet these countries were the leaders in organ donation, with donors per million population twice that of Australia. Our performance improved in 2013 to 16.9 donors per million population, but worldwide data is still incomplete for ranking comparisons. Nonetheless, we can and need to do better. To do so, we have to understand the issues that make families of potential donors consent to or decline organ donation. The paper by Neate et al and the correspondence by Martinez and Kelty on organ donation in this issue are a step forward 1,2 .\n\n Neate and co-contributors interviewed 47 participants from 40 families of suitable potential organ donors to record their reasons why they gave (23 families) or withheld (17 families) consent for organ donation. Consent was favoured mainly due to the deceased's wishes and values, mindful altruism and self-consolation among family members. Donation was declined mainly because of a lack of knowledge about the deceased's views, \"social, cultural, and religious beliefs\", the donation process including \"conversation factors\" and \"family exhaustion\". Martinez and Kelty surveyed medical members of the College of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society for their views on implementing two strategies to increase organ donation: reciprocity and preferred status (as explained in their correspondence). They found no majority support for the policies, but instead a two-thirds majority view that donation should be motivated exclusively by altruism. A required advance directive regarding organ donation was also clearly supported.\n\n The two surveys suffered from low participation rates. Nonetheless, many of Neate et al's findings reflect the anecdotal observations of our DonateLife Western Australia staff. The families of many potential organ donors in general did not refuse organ donation due to dissatisfaction with the healthcare system and mistrust in the integrity of the process, themes that have been more strongly reported overseas, perhaps reflecting the high standards of universal healthcare in our relatively egalitarian society. Similarly reassuring is the finding by Martinez and Kelty of the values of altruism and fairness among our Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care specialists.\n\n While the reasons offered by families in their decision-making are all important, the major ones can be viewed under two themes, or as two areas of foci to increase the pool of organ donors: registration with the Australian Organ Donor Registry (AODR) and the family conversation. The AODR is the only national register for Australians to record their decision about becoming an organ and tissue donor for transplantation after death. While 90% of the Australian population support organ/tissue donation in principle, currently only 39% of Australia's eligible (working age) population are registered, albeit nearly all agreeing to be organ donors (Australian Bureau of Statistics). Almost half of Australians do not know their family members' wishes regarding organ donation. Of those who do, the majority (94%) support these wishes (Organ and Tissue Authority). If more Australians register, from that registration and the subsequent in-family discussions, more families will know the wishes of their loved ones. The likely outcome will be an increase in the consent rate.\n\n Regardless of the deceased having registered antemortem consent in the AODR, Australian practice always seeks consent for organ/tissue donation from the senior next-of-kin. Organ/tissue retrieval does not proceed if family consent is declined. Australia's consent rate of 57% is similar to top western countries, but lags behind Spain's 82%. Although this difference may be attributed to Spain's nationwide, unitary organ donation infrastructure, how families are approached is also immensely important. As doctors, we are professionally beholden to develop and practise skills in imparting bad news to families. These skills are particularly demanding in family conversations for organ donation and need to be honed. Indeed, studies have shown that consent for donation is more likely if the family is approached by staff trained in organ donation 3 . Such personnel will be cognisant of the issues reported by Neate et al, such as cultural and religious, that cause families to decline consent. In general, the major religions in Australia support organ/tissue donation as generous acts that benefit people. It is important to first establish with the family their loved one's clinical status and prognosis, particularly those of irrecoverable brain function, imminent death and end-of-life care. Every effort is made to ensure that the family understands the information provided, especially brain death, and (if considered) donation after circulatory death. The series of discussions present organ donation as a component of end-of-life care and an opportunity for the family to endorse an altruistic act, according to the deceased's wishes and values.\n\n There is no evidence to show that laws and policies aimed at increasing organ/tissue donation, such as reciprocity, preferred status and presumed consent (opt-out) legislation, increase organ donation by themselves. Opt-out legislation has been enacted in some countries with the highest donation rates, and also, paradoxically, by many of the worstperforming countries. Interestingly, all presumed consent countries do not proceed with donation unless the family consents. In Neate et al's report, the reasons offered by families in their decision-making are all important. However, in the writer's view, efforts should best be directed at increasing AODR registration and improving family conversation skills. Education in the latter is conducted by DonateLife agencies to emergency department and intensive care unit staff, a worthwhile upskilling Continuing Professional Development pursuit. Healthcare organisations and the community need to do more to achieve the former.\n\n Perth, Western Australia", "qa": [["3_32730438_0_1", "What are the main factors that contribute to Australia's lower organ donation rates compared to countries with higher rates?\n", "The main factors contributing to Australia's lower organ donation rates include a lack of knowledge about the deceased's views, social, cultural, and religious beliefs, conversation factors, family exhaustion, and a low participation rate in the Australian Organ Donor Registry (AODR).

Substantial literature reviews exist on iatrogenic HPVG, with HPVG observed in patients after laparoscopy [32] , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [31] , liver transplantation [15] , radiofrequency tumor ablation [33] , and barium enema [34] . In various studies as early as 1971, higher survival rates were recognized in iatrogenic HPVG-associated illness compared with natural pathologies. Kinoshita et al. [8] reported a mortality of 39%, which is a significant reduction from 75% that was reported in 1978. The observed reduction in mortality was driven by an increase in the proportion of nonfatal conditions reported with HPVG and without associated mesenteric ischemia. In a cumulative review by Kinoshita et al. [8] , there was no statistical difference in mortality rates between the operated and nonoperated cases in patients with HPVG associated with gastric dilatation, gastric ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or complications of endoscopic procedures, because these conditions are curable with conservative management alone. A review of relevant HPVG articles is presented in (Table 1) .\n\n We report a case of acute gastric dilatation that caused HPVG and gastric emphysema, which was treated by bypassing the obstruction. Our case is unique in that the diagnosis of gastric emphysema as the cause of portal venous gas occurred in the setting of acute gastric dilatation caused by a congenital band that is extremely rare in adults and related to the abnormal anatomy of this patient with Noonan's syndrome.\n\n While HPVG in previous decades was clearly defined as an ominous radiologic finding that portended a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate, today it can be a puzzling finding to reflect a benign etiology. The radiologic presence of HPVG does not necessarily indicate severe underlying pathology. It can be seen in relatively benign situations, such as following endoscopic procedures and gastric dilatation, and may require only conservative therapy. Treatment of patients with HPVG depends mainly on the underlying disease.

Paclitaxel binds to b-tubulin of microtubules [1] , stabilising microtubules and interfering with spindle-microtubule dynamics, arresting mitosis and inducing apoptosis [2] . Painful peripheral neuropathy is the major dose-limiting side-effect of paclitaxel therapy. Patients describe various sensory symptoms including mechanical allodynia, spontaneous pain, cold allodynia, numbness, tingling, in a 'stocking and glove' distribution [3, 4, 5] . Emergence of these symptoms can mean that patients cannot complete optimal chemotherapy schedules [6] thus potentially limiting anti-cancer actions. The incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced pain symptoms correlates with increasing cumulative doses of paclitaxel [7, 8] . Following the cessation of paclitaxel, pain and sensory abnormalities can persist for months or years [5, 9] . Currently, there is no effective therapy for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. Several analgesics with established efficacy in other painful neuropathies have failed to show any efficacy in double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of patients with chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy [10, 11, 12, 13] .\n\n Reactive oxygen species (ROS) e.g. superoxide radical O 2 2 , hydroxyl radical OH . , are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation and usually decomposed by specialised cellular enzymes e.g.superoxide dismutases, peroxidases. In the 1990s, the role of ROS in neuropathic pain was demonstrated with the inhibition of CCI-evoked heat hyperalgesia by novel antioxidants 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) [14] , N-acetylcysteine [15] and tirilazad [16] and increased superoxide dismutase levels in the axotomised sciatic nerve [17] . More recently, pharmacological inhibition of ROS was reported to have anti-nociceptive effects in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models. N-tert-Butyl-a-phenylnitrone (PBN), a non-specific ROS scavenger, inhibited mechanical hypersensitivity evoked by spinal nerve ligation (SNL) [18, 19, 20] , capsaicin-induced inflammation [21, 22] and visceral inflammation [23] . Other non-specific ROS scavengers, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide and nitrosobenzene also relieved neuropathic pain behaviours [18] . Reagents that mimic superoxide dismutase activity (thus specifically scavenging superoxide), inhibited hypersensitivity to mechanical/heat stimuli evoked by either peripheral nerve injury [14, 20] or inflammation [21, 22, 24, 25] . Furthermore, mitochondrial ROS-producing profiles are increased in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury [26] or an inflammatory stimulus [22, 27] .\n\n Our interest in the role of ROS in chemotherapy-induced pain developed after finding swollen/vacuolated mitochondria in peripheral sensory nerves of paclitaxel-treated rats, in the absence of axonal degeneration [28] . These atypical changes in neuronal mitochondria correlated with the paclitaxel-induced pain time course i.e. present during the pain syndrome but not at its resolution [28] . Considering that mitochondria are a major source of ROS as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation, we examined the potential causal role of ROS in chemotherapyinduced painful peripheral neuropathy. Here we compare the effects of systemic administration of two ROS scavengers with differing selectivity, PBN and TEMPOL, on paclitaxel-induced pain. Using a rat model of paclitaxel-induced pain, we assess the ability of PBN, a non-specific ROS scavenger and TEMPOL, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, to a) inhibit established paclitaxelinduced pain and b) counteract the development of paclitaxelinduced pain.\n\n All experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the ethical guidelines issued by the International Association for the Study of Pain [29] .

Moreover, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor augments the mobilization of the endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow, thus contributing to the angiogenic response [9] . Therefore, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor accelerates the healing process through restraining inflammation [10] , restoring angiogenesis [11] and improving connective tissue regeneration and epithelial regeneration [12] .\n\n Regarding the healing process, inflammation corresponds to the accomplishment of homeostasis and the formation of a temporary extracellular matrix to enable the active migration of the monocytes and the fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor beta, a cytokine produced by the cells involved in the healing process, is critically required in the transition from inflammation towards connective tissue regeneration through the demotion of the active migration of the monocytes and the promotion of the proliferation and differentiation of the fibroblasts [13] . Starting immediately following the insult and resolving within 3-4 days, inflammation seems to be the most vulnerable event as far as the deleterious effects of radiation therapy on the healing process are concerned. Radiation therapy significantly depresses the early changes involved in inflammation during the healing process, thus delaying the transition towards connective tissue regeneration [3] . Transforming growth factor beta, on the other hand, promotes the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of the fibroblasts despite the absence of the monocytes in the area of healing, hence augmenting the healing impaired by radiation therapy [14] . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor triggers an imbalance in the production of the endogenous mediators involved in the healing cascade in attempt to counterbalance the impairing effects of radiation therapy on the healing process, presumably leading to the increased production of transforming growth factor beta to generate a state of depressed inflammation [15] .\n\n The healing of the tracheal anastomosis is closely related to the regional mucosal blood flow. Among neoadjuvant treatment strategies, radiation therapy significantly reduces the regional mucosal blood flow, leading to early changes adversely affecting the anastomotic healing including reactive congestion, edema and inhibition of capillary proliferation [16] . Therefore, attempts at improved healing have mainly focused on the reinforcement of the irradiated anastomotic segment with pedicled viable tissue to promote the regional mucosal blood flow [17] .

The basis for the classification of this tumour was worked out by W.H. Clark [1] and V.J. McGovern [2] in the 1970s. The classification which they proposed presents melanoma as a melanocytic lesion, which, within its development, undergoes progression. The first stage is defined as melanoma in situ. This type of melanoma is characterised by the presence of atypical melanocytes: \u2022 melanocytes, located on the entire thickness of the epidermis, are irregularly placed, creating pagetoid-like groups (superficial spreading melanoma in situ); or: \u2022 in the basal layers of epidermis, placed in a linear and lentiginal way (lentigo melanoma in situ).\n\n In the case of melanoma in situ and/ or accompanying melanocyte infiltration in the upper layers of the skin, the prognosis is defined as very good. The phase of melanoma growth is defined as the radial growth phase (RGP). It precedes the melanoma's progression into the skin, a process which consists in transgressing the basal membrane of the epidermis and an infiltration into the lower skin layers with the creation of a nodule. This stage is defined as the vertical growth phase (VGP). It is connected with the progression of a lesion and has a poor prognosis.\n\n The creators of the most recent classification of skin tumours, the \"WHO Classification of Skin Tumours 4 th edition, 2018\" [3] point to two basic types of melanoma: melanomas with the radial phase and those which since their onset begin to develop in a vertical way. The first group comprises: a superficial spreading melanoma and a malignant lentigo. The other group comprises nodular melanoma, which has only a vertical phase and naevoid melanoma, which usually does not have a radial phase.\n\n The above listed melanoma groups differ from one another in terms of their ontogenetic mechanisms, and the genetic changes occurring within them as well as their clinical picture. The main ontogenetic mechanism is the damage caused by the UV radiation connected with exposure to the sun (or artificial UV radiation). High-energy UVB rays, which make up 5% of the radiation which reaches the Earth, penetrate the skin, damaging the epidermis and causing tumours.\n\n The most recent WHO classification proposes the division into the skin melanomas based on the factors which cause the disease: \u2022 significant damage to the skin resulting from a cumulative dose of sun radiation (high cumulative skin damage, high--CSD melanoma); \u2022 and slight damage to the skin caused by a small or sporadic UV exposure (low cumulative skin damage, low-CSD melanoma).\n\n The first group of melanomas contains a large number of punt mutations; in particular the mutations in the following genes are typical: NF1, NRAS, BRAF (other than p. V600E), KIT (MAPK activation pathway), TP53. Melanomas of the skin which have been chronically exposed to sun (high-CSD melanoma/melanocytic tumours in chronically sun-exposed skin) comprise: lentigo malignant melanomas and desmoplastic melanomas. In the low-CSD melanomas, the mutation in the codon 600 BRAF gene is dominating (BRAF p. V600E).

Compounding pharmacies are not required to establish efficacy and safety, obtain FDA approval, or comply with manufacturing and labeling standards for compounded drugs. 5 In contrast, drug manufacturers are regulated by FDA and must comply with good manufacturing practices. Over the past few decades, the regulatory gap between state regulation of traditional compounding practices and FDA regulation of drug manufacturing has allowed the proliferation of compounding pharmacies that distribute large quantities of compounded sterile products nationwide. According to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, 1-3% of all prescriptions in the United States are compounded. 6 An estimated 7500 pharmacies in the United States provide advanced compounding services, 3000 of which provide sterile compounding services. 6 Only about 2% of compounding pharmacies participate in the industry's voluntary accreditation program. 5 Since 2000, FDA has issued numerous warnings about the quality of compounded drugs, 1 including problems with potency [7] [8] [9] [10] and sterility 11 and the presence of particulates 12, 13 or contaminants. 14, 15 In 2001 and 2006, FDA investigators found that 30% of the compounded drug samples they tested contained either too little or too much of the active ingredient, 16, 17 compared with less than 2% of FDA-approved prescription drugs. 16 In the past, potential outbreaks have been averted before compounded drugs reached large numbers of patients. 18 In 2003, a compounding pharmacy that specialized in respiratory drugs issued a partial recall of two batches of albuterol-ipratropium respiratory solution (more than 1 million doses) that were contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia. 11 A full recall was issued after the Missouri Board of Pharmacy obtained a restraining order to halt further dispensing of contaminated respiratory solutions. More than 19,000 patients throughout the United States may have been exposed to the contaminated drug, but no known infections resulted from this event.\n\n We questioned whether infectious outbreaks associated with contaminated compounded drugs are a new or recurring problem and whether there are features associated with compounded drugs or surveillance systems that may hinder outbreak detection. Outbreak detection requires that a person or automated system recognizes unusual events and that systems are in place to enable reporting and investigation. Therefore, the objectives of this analysis were to describe features of infectious outbreaks associated with exposure to contaminated drugs produced by compounding pharmacies outside the hospital setting, sterile compounding procedures associated with microbial contamination, and outbreak features relevant for detection and investigation. 20 This additional search was necessary to query for additional outbreaks and to obtain additional information about previously identified outbreaks.\n\n The analysis focused on infectious outbreaks in the United States that resulted from exposure to drugs that were likely contaminated during production by a compounding pharmacy and was limited to compounding pharmacies that prepared sterile products outside the hospital setting.\n\n After identifying an outbreak that met the selection criteria, information (in order of precedence if content differed between sources) from government publications (including FDA Enforcement Letters and recall notices), peer-reviewed literature, congressional testimony, and meeting abstracts was extracted. The information was used to describe the (1) triggers that led to outbreak detection, (2) number and location of patients involved, (3) drug name and route of administration, (4) infectious organisms and clinical outcomes, (5) name and location of the compounding pharmacy, and (6) findings from the investigation.

Other models involving a possible TH1/TH2 imbalance include mercuric chlorideinduced autoimmunity in mice and rats [89] .\n\n The indication that target cells and autoantigens are directly involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases was first obtained from the study of idiotypic markers carried by autoantibodies, the direct sequencing of autoantibody and the demonstration of target organ dysfunction in some autoimmune situations. The role of autoantigens in autoimmunity may be at different levels. The expression of autoantigens in abnormal forms, their delayed expression during ontogeny, or their quantitatively abnormal expression, possibly relating with target organ dysfunction, may directly trigger an autoimmune reaction. These may result from intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects possibly resulting from the action of virus or toxic agents on target cells. Alternatively, the physiological expression and presentation of autoantigens by MHC antigens may be a simple prerequisite to the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, resulting in an antigen-driven immune response. The persistence of antigens has been shown to be required for maintaining immune tolerance in many experimental designs.\n\n In autoimmune models characterized by polyclonal B-cell activation and a major role of autoantibodies, the preferential usage of V gene families or cross-reactive idiotypes by a significant proportion of autoantibodies with anti-DNA, anti-histone or rheumatoid factor activity and sequencing data showing a high rate of somatic mutations responsible for aminoacid changes on autoantibodies point to antigen-driven immune responses [90] .

In lupus-prone MRL mice in situ hybridization shows a large variation in the extent of V~; gene family usage by in vivo activated spleen B cells among individual mice, and a progressive restriction in the families used with disease development [92] . More direct evidence for the role of target cells in modulating the activation of autoreactive cells has been obtained in the obese strain (OS) chicken which shows increased iodine uptake and organification prior to any lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid and decreased thyroid epithelial cell proliferation in vitro [93] . Diet supplementation with iodine increases the development of thyroiditis and treatments which inhibit iodine transport (KCLO4) or increase thyroid iodine release reduce thyroiditis development in the OS chicken [94] . The direct role of the presence of thyroid target cells in the activation of autoreactive B lymphocytes has been evidenced in thyroidectomized OS chicken which show decreased anti-thyroglobulin autoantibody levels [951.\n\n In the case of autoimmune diabetes, the role of target islet cells has only received indirect experimental support. Both exogenous insulin treatment and glucose injections modulate the development of insulitis and diabetes in the BB rat and/or the NOD mouse [96] [97] [98] . A 50 % reduction of diabetes incidence has been obtained by prophylactic insulin treatment of BB rats.

We speculate that the elimination of AhR ligands is reduced in CKD patients and that increases in AhR ligands may be causes of kidney disease progression. AhR, a ligand-inducible transcription factor, mediates its toxic renal effect by inducing cytochrome p450 proteins, which contribute significantly to renal dysfunction through formation of reactive oxygen species. 11, 12 Furthermore, after classifying patients according to diabetes status, regardless of CKD stage, we found AHRT activity to be higher and intracellular ATP levels to be lower in patients with diabetes than in those without. These results coincide with findings from our previous epidemiologic study. 5 In this study, patients with ESRD under HD and PD showed higher AHRT activity and lower levels of intracellular ATP than patients with normal renal function. Unexpectedly, ESRD patients treated by dialysis showed less elevation of AHRT activity than pre-dialysis CKD patients, suggesting that dialysis may reduce AHRT activity. To evaluate the effect of dialysis on serum AHRT activity, we obtained serial serum samples before and after HD sessions and found that serum AHRT activity decreased after HD. Indoxyl-sulfate and indole-3-acetic acid, well known uremic toxins known to be involved in renal progression, are also known as AhR ligands. 9, 13, 14 They exist in the form of albumin-bound molecules in the body and are unlikely to be removed by dialysis. 15 However, whether and how other individual AhR ligands are affected by dialysis treatment are still ill-defined. As high flux dialysis membranes may have different effects on AHRT activity, further research is mandated to identify the individual molecules among AhR ligands and to compare the effects of HD and hemodiafiltration on AHRT activity in order to determine the exact role of dialysis treatment.\n\n Regarding the relationship between Kt/V and AHRT activity in PD patients, our results showed no relationship between them. It is well-known that PD is more effective in removing larger molecules than HD, and AHRT activity was lower in PD patients than HD patients in this study. There is the possibility that larger protein-bound molecules, including indoxyl sulfate and indole-3 acetic acid, influenced this result. Our data suggest that increased AHRT activity may have an important relationship with the cardiovascular complications of ESRD patients as evidenced by meaningful associations with multiple clinical parameters. AHRT activity was negatively correlated with LDL-cholesterol, hemoglobin, and LVEF. These results suggest that there may be some relationships between malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome in CKD patients and AHRT activity. 16 In MIA syndrome, malnutrition status adversely affects the development of cardiovascular events. 17 Our study did not show an association between AHRT activity and the inflammatory marker CRP, although we suspect that chronic inflammation is the main link between AHRT activity and CKD. In addition, a complex variation in oxidative stress marker levels in CKD has been reported. 18 Therefore, it is necessary to measure and analyze various oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines further to clarify the association between inflammation and AHRT activity. As a reference, in our previous study, AHRT activity exhibited a negative correlation with serum adiponectin, which is known to have significant anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects. 19 Recently, Dou, et al. 20 showed that AhR is increased in patients and mice with CKD, and increased cardiovascular events were observed in CKD patients with increased AhR activities in their survival analyses.\n\n In our study, AHRT activity showed a strong negative correlation with intracellular ATP levels. Given that ATP levels are potent biomarkers of mitochondrial function, our data suggest a possible mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction and increased AHRT activity, as well as their harmful effects on cardiovascular complications, in ESRD patients.\n\n The present study has several limitations. First, this crosssectional observation study did not allow for concluding a causal relationship between AHRT activity and CKD. Second, this was a single-center study with a small sample size. Nationwide and multinational cooperation to clarify the observed association is needed. Third, there are several 'non-classical' AhR ligands other than dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. These include tryptophan and its metabolites and phytochemicals, and the list is growing. 21 In conclusion, we found AHRT activity to be associated with CKD, ESRD, and cardiovascular complications, and dialysis treatment played a role in reducing AHRT activity.

No case of GAS meningitis following cochlear implantation has ever been reported.\n\n Group A streptococcal invasive disease has become increasingly common in recent years, usually involving soft tissues and occasionally progressing to bacteremia and toxic shock syndrome (14) . Despite this increase, GAS bacterial meningitis remains uncommon and accounts for less than 0.2% of all cases of bacterial meningitis, with a total of 51 cases reported worldwide (5, 14, 18) . In The Netherlands, a case series of 41 patients aged 16 years and older with GAS meningitis was published in 2002 (18) . In this report, the mortality rate was 27%, which contrasts with data from the literature that describe a mortality rate of 5 to 10% (5, 14) . In studies with children, Shetty et al. documented 30 cases of GAS meningitis over a 25-year period, from 1976 to 2001. Among these, 52% had a primary focus of infection in the ear, nose, and throat area and blood culture grew GAS in 59% of cases (17) . Although GAS frequently colonizes the oropharynx, it does not usually invade the central nervous system directly and the pathogenesis of primary GAS meningitis remains unclear. In the presence of a positive CSF culture for GAS, penicillin is the antimicrobial agent of choice since antibiotic resistance among isolates of GAS is currently not a clinically significant problem (12, 18) . In more-recent years, GAS meningitis has been associated with a lower mortality if treated promptly. Nevertheless, residual neurological damage, as seen in 46% of children with GAS meningitis, is more common than with H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae meningitis (14, 17) . Our patient also had neurological sequelae, mostly affecting language, which could be directly related to the GAS meningitis or secondary to his implant dysfunction.\n\n The pathogenesis of meningitis among implant recipients remains uncertain. Some cases may be attributed to the procedure itself, justifying the use of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis targeting gram-positive skin flora and middle ear organisms by administration of a narrow-or expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (1) . Based on the most commonly recovered organisms in the CSF (S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae), it is often assumed that the infection has taken the route of the middle ear through the cochlea to the meninges (1). Surprisingly, acute otitis media is evident in only a minority of cases and the incidence of AOM does not appear to increase following cochlear implantation (6, 8, 13) . In the FDA's pediatric study, only 40% of the meningitis cases presenting more then 30 days after surgery occurred in patients with AOM. However, a history of AOM prior to implantation was identified as one of the risk factors for meningitis, along with ventriculoperitoneal-shunt placement, exposure to smoking in the household, inner ear malformation, incomplete insertion of the electrode, and a CSF leak through a fistula (16) . All surgery-related factors should be documented at the time of insertion of the implant and reported to the child's health care provider and parents as potential risk factors for the development of subsequent bacterial meningitis. Among all risk factors listed previously, the presence of an implant with a positioner was the most significant: children wearing these types of implants had 4.5 times the risk of developing meningitis compared to those who had other types of implant (16) . Because of this strong association, manufacturers have voluntarily withdrawn the positioner component of their devices since July 2002 (7).

Therefore, the choice of adsorbent materials and the molding process of electrode preparation are the keys to electroadsorption technology in practical applications.\n\n In order to be able to adsorb more charged particles, the adsorbent must possess a sufficiently large specific surface area, with porous carbon material being the best choice. This paper shall demonstrate how the chemical vapor deposition method was used to prepare CNT/PCF composite electrodes and then shall describe the process performed when studying electroadsorption desalination under different conditions. \n\n \n\n (1) CNT pretreatment: put CNTs into 65% (mass fraction) HNO 3 at 413 K for 4\u223c5 hours, and have them neutralized, washed, and placed in centrifuge, after which CNTs with oxygen-containing reactive groups (such as -COOH and -OH) were obtained [5] . (2) PCF pretreatment: put PAN-based carbon fiber felt into the HNO 3 solution for 1 h, and then have it washed with distilled water to obtain neutralization and dried in vacuum at 393 K for 5 h [6] .\n\n The low pressure and low temperature thermal CVD system was adopted in this experiment, as shown in Figure 1 . Ni was used as a catalyst and was deposited on the surface of graphite substrates. Hydrogen and acetylene were, respectively, used as the carrier gas and carbon feed stock, the flow rates of which were, respectively, controlled at 50 and 100 sccm. Reaction temperatures were at 823 K, and CNTs were dispersed on the PCF matrix. After deposition, the CNT/PCF composite had to be immersed into 1 mol/L HCl solution to remove the catalyst so that the influence of residues on electroadsorption could be avoided. The composite was then dried and shaped at 393 K to prepare for electrodes. Electrode size in this electroadsorption experiment module is 100 mm \u00d7 50 mm \u00d7 2 mm (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 thickness). Assemble electrodes into desalinator, as shown in Figure 2 . After being electrified, brine first flowed through this device at a certain rate, at which point the conductivity of the outlets could be tested, as shown in Figure 3 .\n\n \n\n , we can see that carbon nanotubes wind around the PAN-based carbon fiber felt and form a threedimensional conductive network nanostructure consisting of mesopores and a smaller amount of micropores. More micropores contact directly with the adsorbate, which can be exposed to the fiber surface for adsorption and desorption, meaning that the adsorption equilibrium can be reached quickly [7] . On the other hand, microspores shall increase the electrical double-layer overlapping effect and reduce electrosorption capacity according to the discussion led by Yang et al. [8] . Therefore, this kind of 3D network structure not only increases the external surface (the fiber diameter generally being between 10 and 13 m), but also suppresses the micropores' distribution as well. It thus becomes easier for micropores to contact with the adsorbate, so diffusion resistance decreases, which is beneficial for adsorptive separation without reducing the adsorption rate. Furthermore, since the nanotubes with curved winding structure are dispersed in the carbon felt, the resistivity of electrodes reduces while conductivity improves, with electrode strength also enhancing.\n\n Desalination. Prepare 1 mol/L NaCl solution, put 20 mL into electroadsorption module container, set closed-circuit voltage to 1.4 V, and adopt two kinds of electrodes (PCF electrode and CNT/PCF composite electrode) with the same mass. As shown in Figure 5 , both desalination rates increase with the passage of time. When CNT/PCF composite electrodes are used, the conductivity of outlets decreases sharply within the first 20 minutes before then becoming gentle; after 80 minutes, this state remains generally unchanged.", "qa": [["16_15496199_0_1", "What are the advantages of using the electroadsorption desalination method compared to other water purification methods?\n", "The electroadsorption desalination method offers advantages such as lower energy consumption, higher water yield, and reduced secondary pollution to the environment compared to other water purification methods like distillation, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and ion exchange.

More recently, hypoxia has been demonstrated to be crucial for normal marrow hematopoiesis [4] [5] [6] . However, the role of hypoxia in the etiology, pathogenesis, and possible treatment of hematological malignancies, such as MM, is still unknown.\n\n Given very low oxygen levels, as found in tumors, are rarely observed in normal tissues, the presence of hypoxic tumor cells is therefore regarded not only as an adverse prognostic factor but also as a potential target for tumor-specific treatment.

In solid tumors, hypoxia is one of the microenvironmental factors that drives tumor progression and treatment resistance. MM develops in a specialized BM microenvironment, which has been shown to be low in oxygen tension, however, our knowledge in this field is still in its infancy and many details are unkown.

In addition, the data from TH-302 treated naive mice show no significant toxicity in body weight, hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (HCT) and MVD, compared to the vehicle-treated naive mice, further indicating the specific hypoxia-activated effect of TH-302 and the limited hypoxia in the normal BM (Supplementary Figure 7) .", "qa": [["40_10413059_0_1", "How does hypoxia affect the progression and treatment resistance of multiple myeloma?\n", "Hypoxia, which is characterized by low oxygen levels, plays a significant role in driving the progression and treatment resistance of multiple myeloma (MM).

Internal medicine does not seek training grants for its general internal medicine residency, but rather focuses its efforts in research on clinical fellows committed to further training in medicine subspecialty divisions. All ACGME-approved internal medicine and pediatric subspecialty fellowships have significant required research components. 64, 65 In contrast, as a specialty, we have no recognizable commitment to providing research experience during subspecialty fellowship training. None of our ACGME-approved fellowships have a research requirement (although some have such a recommendation), in contrast to those of our peer specialties. Moreover, anesthesiology has been slow to seek accreditation of most its subspecialty disciplines (i.e., obstetric/gynecologic, cardiothoracic, neurologic), although efforts by the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiology have been made in terms of standardizing training within cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellowships. 66 Unfortunately, unlike our colleagues in medicine and pediatrics, we have not created a sufficient number of high-caliber academic fellowships that could provide a platform to foster substantial numbers of physician scientists across the anesthesiology disciplines. In contrast, our peers continue to value and support the compulsory research components of their subspecialty training programs and even continue to form new ones, with a conviction that science and medicine must be integrated in the training of subspecialist physicians, even for those who ultimately pursue private practice.\n\n The academic leadership in these specialties, particularly medicine and pediatrics, are absolutely clear in their commitment to continue and invigorate their researchbased subspecialty fellowships and believe these programs provide the deep \"bench\" that supports the academic future of their professions.\n\n Although department-sponsored NIH training grants are a general measure of research interest and activity at the postdoctoral stages of training, investigator-initiated NIH career development (K series) grants remain the key indicator of continued interest in research at the evercritical junior faculty career stage. The most common K series career development awards in clinical departments include the K08 (clinicians performing basic science research) and K23 (clinicians performing clinical research).\n\n 33 K series awards are usually 5 yr in duration, require (and provide partial salary support for) 75% research time, and also require the financial support and direct supervision of a senior faculty mentor with a successful NIH-funded research program. NIH committees not only evaluate the applicant and his or her research plan and preliminary data, but also consider the quality of the proposed mentor, including his or her funding and publication record and track record for managing trainees into successful independent research careers. As shown in table 2, the number of all K series grants awarded to anesthesiology departments in the United States lags far behind other subspecialties, paralleling the overall poor performance of the specialty in other types of NIH funding. When our training practices are considered relative to the higher expectations for subspecialty training of academic faculty in other specialties, the root cause behind the small number of proposals being submitted to the NIH and other agencies by anesthesiology fellows and junior faculty becomes clear. In simple terms, we set extraordinarily low expectations in regard to the research accomplishments of our finest trainees at the terminal phase of their training. Our peer specialties view this as a critical time to reinforce, not back away from, compulsory research training.\n\n It is our view that we, as a specialty, have reaped what we have sown. Students correctly see anesthesiology as a specialty that does not view research as essential. \"After all,\" students astutely tell us, \"fellowships in anesthesiology are great because they aren't so long and don't even require research.\" Without substantive research training in either basic or clinical research, anesthesiology does not produce individuals capable of or even interested in applying for NIH K award funding as junior faculty members. As such, we consistently and painfully hear from medical students in our own institutions, as well as from faculty colleagues in medicine and pediatrics who outnumber us and counsel those students on their career choices, that they consider anesthesiology to be weak in its commitment to research training because of its lack of commitment to subspecialty fellowship training with compulsory research years.", "qa": [["80_1534815_4_1", "What are the reasons behind the low number of NIH-funded department-sponsored research training grants in anesthesiology residency programs?\n", "The low number of NIH-funded department-sponsored research training grants in anesthesiology residency programs can be attributed to several factors.

Additionally, anesthesiology has been slow to seek accreditation for its subspecialty disciplines, further limiting research opportunities within the field.
