Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols.

They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

These include increases in respiratory rate, tidal ventilation, and oxygen consumption (18) ; increases in cardiac output, pulse pressure, and heart rate (19, 20) ; reductions in systemic vascular resistance (2 1); regional peripheral vasoconstriction (22) ; reduction in blood eosinophil count and increase in neutrophil count (23) ; histological renal and hepatic changes (24) and increase in blood SGOT concentration (24) ; chest and abdominal discomfort and pain (25) ; and death (26) . Despite these reported adverse effects of vibration, HFV has been introduced for clinical practice without a full evaluation of its safety. This point has recently been emphasized by the description of hepatic abnormalities in neonatal baboons ventilated with internal oscillation (27) .\n\n Our concerns regarding the toxicity of vibration have led us to attempt to establish the probable safety of EHFO prior to instituting human investigation. In a controlled comparison of CMV and EHFO for 8 h in the cat, no difference was shown between the two modes of ventilation regarding changes in serum electrolyte and hepatic enzyme concentrations, and the gross and microscopic pathology of vital organs (28) .

We therefore anticipated that, if any effect of ventilatory mode was noted, EHFO would be associated with an increase in Q. Although we did not measure pleural and therefore transpulmonary pressures in our animals, Q was unaffected by ventilatory mode despite a higher transthoracic pressure on EHFO. Attenuation of the applied pressures probably occurred at the chest wall, and we suspect that the transpulmonary pressures on EHFO were less than the measured mean transthoracic pressures, and thus may have been comparable to those on CMV.\n\n There was no apparent difference between the two ventilatory modes in terms of CBF/C02 response.

The assumption that an available AED always would be used to treat a nearby arrest is based upon the finding of several studies examining the use of AEDs by layresponders. 8, 10, 20 These studies found that all cardiac arrest victims in casinos, a sports stadium, and an international airport were promptly treated by lay responders using available AEDs. However, it also is possible to envision circumstances in which a cardiac arrest victim might not receive treatment with a nearby AED, despite its availability (probability of cardiac arrest is greater than probability of AED use); this possibility was evaluated using sensitivity analysis. The baseline probability of cardiac arrest (0.2 arrests per site per year) was drawn from the American Heart Association recommendation concerning AED deployment. 1 We defined a site as a geographic area that could reasonably be serviced by a single centrally located AED. For example, a private residence is considered a single site while a sports stadium requiring multiple devices would instead contain several sites.\n\n The range of probabilities of cardiac arrests at various sites was derived from the published medical literature (Table 2) .\n\n 10,15\u00b117 Certain large facilities such as airports may have a high annual incidence of cardiac arrests on location, but because of their size, require a correspondingly large number of AEDs to be deployed and consequently, each AED has a low annual probability of being used. Similarly, certain small facilities such as health clubs may have a low annual incidence of cardiac arrests, but can be serviced by a single centrally placed AED.\n\n The cost estimates used in the model are shown in Table 1 . AED costs were estimated both by review of the published literature as well as discussion with device manufacturers. AEDs cost approximately $2,000, but this cost is amortized over an expected useful life of 10 years, resulting in an annual cost of $200 per device deployed. 21 Training costs were based upon an expectation that 4 employees would each require 2 hours of training per year per AED deployed, and that these employees would earn 150% their normal wage of $14.00 per hour during training. 22 22 \n\n The benefit of AED deployment stems from any increase in life expectancy afforded by the availability of AEDs on-site (strategy 2) when compared to EMS-D care (strategy 1). The probability of survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to hospital discharge under strategy 1 was estimated to be 10%.\n\n \n\n While several studies have now demonstrated survival rates of 50% with public use of AEDs, it is likely that AED effectiveness would be significantly lower in less-controlled environments. 8\u00b110 Based upon an average time-to-shock interval of 4.5 minutes, a survival rate of 25% appears more consistent with the published literature.\n\n Life Gained From AED\n\n The life expectancy for cardiac arrest survivors was calculated based upon an expected mortality of 20% during the first year after arrest and 15% thereafter, and takes into account the fact that many cardiac arrest survivors would receive implantable cardiac defibrillators. \n\n Because of uncertainty regarding the precise values of model inputs, sensitivity analysis was performed using 3 different techniques. First, 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed for each model input across the entire range of values reported in the literature. Second, 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed for selected inputs that were identified as critical in the 1-way analyses. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. This method repeatedly samples from each of the input variables' distribution ranges, calculating costs and effectiveness for each simulation. 40 For the purposes of our analysis, the Monte Carlo simulation was conducted while holding the probability of cardiac arrest and probability of AED use at their base-case values (20% and 100%, respectively), and allowing all other model inputs to vary freely across the range of reported values. For this analysis, cost variables were assigned lognormal distributions. 41 All other variables were assigned normal distributions. 40 \n\n \n\n The base-case analysis assumes a 20% annual probability of cardiac arrest at the site of each deployed AED (1 arrest every 5 years).

Young, prediabetic, ZDF rats (< 14 weeks) have significantly increased plasma insulin levels compared to their wild-type littermates to compensate for insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), whereas in older ZDF rats, plasma insulin levels continuously decline in parallel with progressing \u03b2-cell dysfunction due to oxidative and glucotoxic damage as well as exhaustion of insulin content [44, 45] . However, insulin-sensitivity is not fully restored as shown by the only partially normalized blood glucose values (fasting and non-fasting) and HbA1c values as well as the obvious hyperinsulinemia in the plasma of all ZDF groups. The increase in insulin plasma levels in ZDF rats with different SGLT2i drugs is well documented [25, [46] [47] [48] [49] . Of importance is that empagliflozin was shown to lower blood glucose levels (thereby sparing insulin) in a preclinical model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes [50] and also in human studies [51, 52] .\n\n SGLT2i treatment appears to be highly efficient in preventing glucotoxicity, i.e. increased methylglyoxal levels, formation of AGE and the induction of RAGE-dependent signaling. Importantly, methylglyoxal has recently been demonstrated to play an essential role in the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy in diabetic mice and patients, and therefore represents a target of special interest for pharmacological modulation [53] . Increased AGE/RAGE signaling was reported for diabetic rats [54] , which contributes to oxidative stress and vascular complications [55] via activation of NADPH oxidases [12] and impairment of \u2022 NO/cGMP signaling [55] . Our data support impaired \u2022 NO/cGMP signaling (as suggested by reduced P(Ser239)-VASP levels, the substrate of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-1)) with vascular dysfunction (for detailed mechanism see Fig. 2E ), which is best explained by direct oxidative inactivation of the constituents of this pathway (e.g. thiol oxidation in sGC, oxidative break-down of \u2022 NO, and oxidative depletion of BH4) [56, 57] but also adverse phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495 by protein kinase C [40, 41] . Our ChIP data on histone modification at the eNOS promoter show that the activating H3K4me3 mark is decreased throughout all ZDF groups and not restored by SGLT2i treatment supporting that improved \u2022 NO/cGMP signaling by empagliflozin is not based on upregulation of eNOS gene but potentially on prevention of oxidative damage of the \u2022 NO/cGMP signaling pathway. Likewise, RAGE-antagonism improved late-stage diabetic complications such as hind limb ischemia in T1DM mice [58] , nephropathy in ZDF rats [59] [60] [61] and microvascular damage in T1DM rats [62] .\n\n According to previous data AGE/RAGE signaling triggers low-grade inflammation [16] as supported by the protein and mRNA expression data and oxidative stress measurements of this study. All of these adverse effects were normalized by SGLT2i treatment in accordance with the previously reported anti-inflammatory effects of empagliflozin in a model of atherosclerosis [63] . It should be noted that also other recent anti-diabetic drugs provide efficient glycemic control in diabetic conditions as reported for linagliptin and sitagliptin and other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, in ZDF and obese rats [64] [65] [66] .\n\n In the present study, the interplay between AGE/RAGE signaling, oxidative stress and inflammation is reflected by increased oxidative stress markers in various tissues and whole blood. We observed increased ROS formation in aorta, heart, kidney, serum and whole blood. In addition, we show that empagliflozin, sitagliptin and the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 improved viability and \u2022 NO formation in HUVECs under hyperglycemic conditions. The partial protection provided by the RAGE inhibitor underlines the significant contribution of AGE/RAGE signaling to the underlying pathophysiology of hyperglycemia and glucotoxicity, which is also reflected by the above discussed therapeutic efficacy of RAGE antagonists in diabetic animals.\n\n Interestingly, ROS formation in the adventitia, as an example for adipose tissue, was increased, which could be associated with dysregulated adipokine synthesis.", "qa": [["30_20708294_9_1", "How does SGLT2i treatment affect glucose homeostasis in prediabetic rats?\n", "SGLT2i treatment, such as empagliflozin, appears to preserve the two major mechanisms involved in glucose homeostasis in prediabetic rats.

Another in vitro study showed that LV c-fos and c-myc mRNA levels and the rate of phenylalanine incorporation into cardiac proteins were increased in isolated perfused adult rat hearts subjected to increased systolic load and that AT 1 R blockade with losartan did not prevent these hypertrophic responses (17) . Thus, there is considerable evidence indicating independence of development of LV hypertrophy from RAS activation. However, previous studies failed to characterize the difference between RAS-dependent and RAS-independent LV hypertrophies. Characteristics of RAS-dependent hypertrophy. First, RAS activation may be involved in concentric geometrical LV chamber remodeling at 13 weeks old. Relative wall thickness was greater in CAND(\u03ea) rats than it was in the control rats, and the increase was attenuated by chronic AT 1 R antagonist administration without any effect on LVMI. The difference in chamber size accounts for subnormal systolic wall stress in CAND(\u03ea) rats and for normal systolic wall stress in CAND(\u03e9) rats. The significant elevation of ACE mRNA at 13 weeks in CAND(\u03ea) rats may support the idea that RAS activation is already, although partially, involved in compensatory hypertrophy in CAND(\u03ea) rats. Sugishita et al. (18) showed in hypertensive patients that regression of LV hypertrophy was not achieved with the administration of the antihypertensives, such as Ca channel antagonist and diuretics, in the condition of subnormal systolic wall stress. They speculate the involvement of neurohumoral factors in LV geometrical changes in such patients. Our data may explain the failure to obtain regression of LV hypertrophy with the use of Ca channel antagonist or diuretics in their patients. The RAS may have been abnormally activated in their patients. Future studies are needed both from the molecular and clinical viewpoints to disclose the relation between RAS activation and geometrical remodeling.\n\n Second, we showed that RAS activation and signaling through the AT 1 R is associated with excessive hypertrophy and a transition to heart failure. After 13 weeks, LVMI in CAND(\u03ea) rats progressively increased in spite of lower than or equal to normal systolic wall stress up to 19 weeks. Although AT 1 R antagonist administration did not affect LVMI at 13 weeks old, it suppressed the progressive development of additional LV hypertrophy thereafter. These results suggest that LV hypertrophy in CAND(\u03ea) rats after 13 weeks may be related to RAS activation. This idea is supported by the data of ACE mRNA levels, which were elevated in CAND(\u03ea) rats and were reduced by AT 1 R antagonist administration at 19 weeks. A recent in vitro study showed that AT 1 R antagonist, losartan, inhibited AT II-induced upregulation of ACE mRNA in neonatal cardiac myocytes (19) .\n\n In addition, excessive hypertrophy was accompanied by interstitial fibrosis in this study. We previously reported that interstitial fibrosis also occurred after 13 weeks in the CAND(\u03ea) rats (13) . These structural changes may well contribute to LV dysfunction, particularly to diastolic dysfunction, because the effects of fibrosis on LV diastolic properties are well known (20, 21) . In fact, although midwall fractional shortening was not different among the three groups, LV diastolic filling pattern was characterized by high E and low A waves (restrictive pattern) at 19 weeks in the CAND(\u03ea) rats, suggesting the presence of advanced LV diastolic dysfunction without severe systolic dysfunction (22) . This interpretation was supported by the abnormal values of LV high fidelity pressure-derived parameters, that is, LV end-diastolic pressure and a reference of LV relaxation, Tau. Thus, both excessive hypertrophy and massive RAS-Dependent Versus RAS-Independent Hypertrophy interstitial fibrosis are characteristics of RAS-dependent hypertrophy, which is likely to contribute to the progression of LV diastolic dysfunction and, hence, to the transition to heart failure, particularly diastolic heart failure. Interaction with ET pathway in RAS-dependent hypertrophy. Renin-angiotensin system activation has been considered to interact with other neurohumoral factors, particularly ET-1.

Because of the knowledge that core temperatures can drop rapidly, even with passive cooling, the referral centers were urged to contact the neonatologist at the receiving center for further instructions if the core temperature dropped below 34 \u00b0 C, or if they had any other questions, prior to the transport team's arrival. Upon receiving the transport call, the transport team was quickly mobilized. The transport isolette was programmed to 28 \u00b0 C.

This precise temperature control was achieved by passive cooling measures, active cooling measures with the application of perineal cold packs by MEDLINE gel packs (peri-packs), or if necessary, using the radiant warmer/isolette to warm the infant if the temperature dropped below 34 \u00b0 C. Upon arrival at the referral center, the infant's rectal temperature was immediately obtained, and an assessment was done to confirm TH entry criteria had been met. Then, an esophageal probe was placed for continuous core temperature monitoring. Initiation time for TH was documented when the infant had his or her first recorded temperature of 34 \u00b0 C or less. This marked the beginning of the 72 hours of cooling. The goal for transport was to maintain the temperature between 33 \u00b0 C and 35 \u00b0 C throughout the duration of the transport (see Figure 3 ). Upon arrival to the receiving facility, a final core temperature was recorded and the infant was placed on a servo-controlled cooling blanket to continue the TH process per our in-hospital protocols.

The item-level ceiling effects range from 0.4% (Orientation) to 8.7% (Mood) with a median of 3.9%. The standard deviation was similar for all items, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. There was no difference in QDRS scoring between spouse and nonspouse informants compared with gold standard ratings of cognition, function, or behavior (F 5 0.032, P 5 .86). Thus, data quality for the QDRS were excellent.\n\n \n\n The degree to which the QDRS was free from random error by assessing the internal consistency with Cronbach alpha for Total QDRS scores and two subdomains: cognitive and behavioral. The internal consistency was excellent (0.86-0.93, Table 5 ). The QDRS covered the entire range of possible scores and the mean, median, and standard deviation demonstrated a sufficient dispersion of scores for the assessing and monitoring the presence and severity of dementia with low percentage of missing data. There were very low floor (2.5-8.7%) and ceiling (0.4%) effects, especially for cognitive domain questions. The two factors (cognitive and behavioral) were moderately correlated suggesting they are related but substantially distinct. The total QDRS was internally consistent with scale score features that demonstrated ample dispersion of scores for both the QDRS total score and subscales.\n\n Construct validity of the QDRS is the correspondence of how well each domain corresponds to a theorized trait. Table 6 lists the QDRS domains and the corresponding rating scales and neuropsychological tests. Demonstration of moderate to strong correlations (40%) between individual QDRS domains and rating scales and neuropsychological tests support convergent validity, suggest the QDRS domain and the corresponding test tap into similar constructs. Conversely, low correlations (30%) between individual QDRS domains and rating scales and neuropsychological tests support divergent validity, suggest there is no relationship between dissimilar constructs. For example, the Memory and Recall domain is convergent with tests of episodic and semantic memory, but not with mood, behavior, psychomotor, or executive function. Function within and outside the home is convergent with extrapyramidal signs, behavior, alertness, and episodic memory, but not with mood, semantic memory, or executive function. Toileting and Personal Hygiene is convergent with behavior, extrapyramidal signs, and alertness, but not with cognitive performance or mood. Attention and Concentration is convergent with alertness, behavior, and fluctuations, but not with mood or cognitive performance.\n\n The extent to which the QDRS total and subscales separate the known groups of cognitive impairment, defined by CDR staging, is evidence of known group validity (Table 2) Table 7 . The distribution of the total QDRS, Cognitive and Behavioral subdomains, and QDRS-derived CDR and CDR-SB scores by MMSE cut-offs defining controls, MCI, mild, moderate, and severe dementia is shown in Table 8 .\n\n The range of QDRS and CDR-SB scores by global CDR stages is shown in Table 9 . Both the QDRS and CDR-SB demonstrate a range of scores within each global CDR stage reflecting the range of symptoms reported by the informant, and in the case of the CDR the performance of the patient. To aid in interpreting the QDRS scores, we performed ROC curves for the QDRS to derive cut-off scores that can assist clinicians and researchers (Table 9 ). For discriminating CDR 0 normal controls (with and without subjective complaints) from CDR 0.5 very mild impairment (which includes MCI and very mild dementia), a cut-off score of 1.5 provides the best sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.846; 95% CI 0.76-0.93, P , .001).

One disadvantage of this process relates to the significant quantities of excess sludge that are generated, which in some cases are as high as 50-60% of the total operational expenses of the wastewater treatment plants [1] . Post-treatment is thus presently broadly used for the disposal of activated sludge, which reduces the costs of transportation and further treatment. As a result of the great operational complexity and cost of the post-treatment processes, there has been an increased focus on the use of in situ excess sludge reduction processes, as they can lower excess sludge production at the origin [2] [3] [4] . In this regard, different approaches of microbiological or chemical processes have been employed, such as lysis-cryptic growth [5] , maintenance metabolism [6] , predation on bacteria [7] and uncoupled metabolism [8] [9] [10] . Of these techniques, uncoupled metabolism facilitated by the addition of metabolic uncouplers has been shown to be an incredibly effective technique.\n\n Of the above-mentioned in situ excess sludge reduction technologies, the metabolic uncoupler is most widely accepted, since it can seamlessly feed into the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant, which avoids the necessity to change the conventional wastewater treatment process; because the metabolic uncoupler is usually a lipophilic soluble acid, it can transport protons across the cell membrane and result in partial decomposition due to catabolism and anabolism [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , which brings about reduced production of bacterial cell mass [16] . A variety of metabolic uncouplers, including 2,4-dinitrophenol (dNP), para-nitrophenol (pNP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (dCP), and 3,3 ,4 ,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), have been used in the reduction of sludge yield [13, 17, 18] in sequencing batch reactors and batch experiments. TCS has been applied in the production of soaps, body washes, shampoos, and other products [19] , and is believed to constitute a mild and environmentally friendly metabolic uncoupler [18] . TCS effectively reduces additional sludge production, including at very low concentrations. A TCS quantity of 0.8-1.0 mg/L in a batch system is reported to result in a 40% depletion in sludge yield [17] .\n\n The majority of studies on metabolic uncouplers have been aimed at determining their capacity to decrease biomass production and the impacts of chemical uncouplers on substrate removal efficiency [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In contrast with the widespread evaluation of the utilization of metabolic uncouplers, the enhancement mechanisms of sludge depletion by uncouplers have not been systematically analyzed to date. Additionally, the impact of chemical uncouplers on the inhibition of microorganism activity has not been comprehensively assessed. Moreover, what the remaining part of the substrate is used for and where the energy is utilized remain unknown. Several recent studies have evaluated the connection among microbial offerings and sludge depletion with the addition of metabolic uncouplers. Soluble microbial products (SMP), which consist of proteins, polysaccharides, humic acid, DNA, and lipids, are required to offer a safety shield for the bacteria within the activated sludge.\n\n In the current evaluation, the effects of TCS addition on extra sludge yield and nutrient elimination were evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of TCS on microbial activity inhibition and energy distribution was also investigated. We believe that the findings will help improve our comprehension of the reaction of activated sludge systems to metabolic deodorants, such as TCS in biological wastewater treatment.\n\n \n\n The activated sludge utilized in the experiments was sampled at a local municipal wastewater treatment plant, following which it was sieved (2-mm mesh) to eliminate coarse pieces. Prior to experimentation, the sludge was cultivated at room temperature in six identical sequencing batch reactors (SBR), each with a working volume of 3.2 L. The SBRs were operated for four cycles daily, and every cycle lasted 6 h. There were five stages in each cycle: fill (30 min), react (4 h with aeration), settle (1 h), draw (20 min), and idle (10 min).

Kyphosis Fifty-nine baboons were kept alive for more than a month after laminectomy. Ordinarily this was of the last four lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum, but in 10 of the 59 the sacrum was not included in the laminectomy, and in three of them five lumbar vertebrae were included. About three-quarters of the baboons developed some lumbar kyphosis, usually slight. It was severe in six animals. Its effect on breathing may have predisposed to the pneumonia from which one of these six died, and its mechanical effect on the implant was probably the cause of late damage to the right L5 root in one other (B44; see below). With these exceptions the kyphosis, even when severe, seemed to cause the animals no inconvenience.\n\n Damage to nerve roots apparently occurring at or immediately after implantation The implants were designed primarily for ventral nerve roots, and the slots were made so that no ventral root was a tight fit in its slot. However, dorsal roots (which are about twice as large as ventral) were fairly often inserted into slots in which they fitted tightly. Many of these dorsal roots were found to be inexcitable, and it seems likely that they failed from ischaemia very soon after implantation.\n\n In two baboons operated on in 1970, ventral roots were split in continuity into four or five strands, and some of the smaller of these strands were subsequently found to be inexcitable. In later years, 46 ventral roots in 11 baboons have been split in continuity, each into two, three, or occasionally four approximately equal strands. Of 118 such strands subsequently tested, only five have been found to be inexcitable.\n\n Three baboons (B35, B37, and B38) received in 1972 implants more ambitious (in terms of number of slots) than any earlier ones. These three animals had weakness of both legs on the day after operation, and subsequently showed wasting, chiefly of L4-5 myotome distribution. Subsequently, as my technique improved, even more ambitious implants (B46, B72, B76) were inserted without damage to roots.\n\n Damage to nerve roots probably occurring between one day and two weeks after implantation\n\n In one paraplegic female baboon (B32) in which a radio receiver had been implanted subcutaneously so that the S1 and S2 nerve roots could be stimulated at will without anaesthetic, the roots were found to be functioning well on the first two days after implantation, but poorly on the third, G. S. Brindley fourth, and eighth days. The animal was killed on the ninth day, and pus around the implant and cauda equina was found at necropsy. This was the only animal in which serious infection of a cauda equina implant occurred.\n\n In one baboon certainly (B19, on necropsy evidence), and in two probably (B63 and B64, on radiological evidence), early failure of the S1 and S2 roots can be attributed to backward displacement of the implant, which stretched or broke the roots. The operation has now been modified so that this is unlikely to happen again. The damaged roots in B63 and B64 subsequently regenerated.\n\n Late damage to nerve roots This occurred only in B44. This baboon was killed 25 months after insertion of an implant which trapped, on the right side only, the fifth lumbar ventral nerve root unsplit, the seventh lumbar dorsal root unsplit, the sixth lumbar ventral root split into three strands, and the sixth lumbar dorsal root and the seventh lumbar ventral root each split into two strands. All roots and strands were excitable at five weeks, and there was no wasting at four, 12, or 15 months, but at 23 months moderate wasting of the right quadriceps muscle (innervated chiefly by L5 nerve root in the baboon) was noticed. At necropsy it was found that the part of the implant in which the fifth lumbar ventral root was trapped had rotated, probably as a result of the slowly increasing spinal deformity. The damage to the right L5 root was not complete, for electrical stimulation of it at 25 months caused extension of the knee.

[1] Every year, 5 lakh children die in India due to vaccine-preventable diseases, and another 89 lakhs remain at risk due to partial or no immunization. [2] According to the WHO, vaccine hesitancy refers to a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy reduces vaccine coverage. This poses particular problems in low-and middle-income countries with higher incidence of vaccine-preventable deaths. Several factors have been said to influence vaccine hesitancy, including sociocultural context, religious beliefs, misinformation spread through social media, historical influences and mistrust, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines, and specific characteristics of the vaccines.\n\n The state of Tamil Nadu, which has some of the best health indicators in the country, has an interesting history of vaccination coverage. In the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 1 (1992-1993) , the coverage of all basic vaccines was about 65%, which increased to 89% in NFHS 2 (1998) (1999) . NFHS 3 (2005 NFHS 3 ( -2006 ) saw a vaccination coverage rate of 81%, a reduction over the coverage in NFHS 2 and the NFHS 4 (2015-2016) saw a further reduction to 69%. This trend of reducing vaccination coverage in a high-performing state is a matter of concern. One possible reason for the reduced vaccine uptake in Tamil Nadu could be vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India. The participants included in the study were mothers of children between 1 and 5 years of age attending the pediatrics outpatient department of the tertiary care hospital. A sample size of 150 was arrived at to estimate a 40% prevalence of vaccine hesitancy with a 95% confidence and 20% relative precision. Participants who met this criterion were consecutively selected from the outpatient clinic in the period of June-July 2018. The study used a questionnaire which comprised three parts, namely -(1) sociodemographic details of the respondent, spouse, and child and (2) a scale to measure the vaccine hesitancy. The parental attitude toward child vaccines scale is a valid and reliable measure of parental attitudes and vaccine hesitancy. [3] This scale has not been previously validated for the Indian context. Therefore, the scale was validated by content validity method among experts in pediatrics and public health who evaluated the relevance of the scale in the Indian context and cultural and social appropriateness of the statements in the scale. The questionnaire was translated to Tamil, the local language and the validity of translation checked by an independent expert. The interviews were conducted by the lead author, a 2 nd -year MBBS student as part of her research study. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the institution of origin of this study. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants before data collection. Adequate privacy was provided during the interviews, and the details of the participants were maintained in strict confidentiality. Table 1 shows the responses of the parents to vaccine hesitancy questions. It is noteworthy that there is a tendency of suspicion toward newer vaccines that are introduced (61.4%), concerns about adverse events following vaccination (90.7%), and a feeling that vaccines are not necessary for diseases that are not common (85.3%). These responses indicate a sense of hesitancy of the sample and the main concerns for their hesitation. It is seen that about 5.3% of the sample had a high level of vaccine hesitancy. Table 2 shows the major factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Backward conditional logistic regression analysis was performed with all the following factors included into the model -age of the mother, education of the mother, age of the father, education of the father, sex of the child, number of siblings, monthly family income, use of social media by mother, use of social media by father, and source of information regarding vaccines. It is seen that education of the mother protects against vaccine hesitancy (0.607; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.406-0.907), whereas father's education increases it (1.438; 95% CI 1.007-2.055).", "qa": [["11_207933449_0_1", "What are some factors that influence vaccine hesitancy?\n", "Factors that influence vaccine hesitancy include sociocultural context, religious beliefs, misinformation spread through social media, historical influences and mistrust, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines, and specific characteristics of the vaccines.

Furthermore, this criticism disregards the fact that the industry experts produced mainly single-author reports at the behest of the tobacco companies (although some declared independence) that were not peer-reviewed.\n\n Adopting the litigation model. The industry reviews appeared to be embedded within a litigation-not scientificmodel. Some industry experts referred to parts of their reports that would normally be labelled 'appendix' or 'chapter' as 'exhibits', and their critiques resembled courtroom testimonies aimed at demolishing the adversary's case. In the main TTC submissions, the experts were posited as sources of higher scientific authority, representing 'the best contemporary scientific thinking' [33] and were cited extensively. Demonstrating credibility was an important part of this project, with author CVs in the expert reports ranging between 10 and 20 pages and in one instance taking up 61 pages of a 98-page report [41] . Privileging the individual expert is a legal phenomenon and the legitimacy ascribed to individual experts' testimonies in the courts is fundamentally different from collectively established and consensus-based scientific legitimacy developed within specialised 'communities of practice' [74] . The tobacco company commissioned experts, working outside the peer-review system, dismissed the (peer-reviewed) evidence base for SP as flawed and unusable. In doing so, it was clear that they were attempting to establish an alternative system of scientific legitimacy.\n\n Another manifestation of the litigation model was the experts' piece-by-piece approach to reviewing. Individual studies were examined in depth to determine whether any-on its ownconstituted a warrant for SP and, following systematic deconstruction, none was found to be good enough to justify SP.\n\n 'In summary \u2026 it is my expert opinion that none of the Studies provide [sic] reliable evidence that plain packaging would be effective in achieving the public policy goals of changing actual smoking behaviour \u2026' [40] .\n\n In court, each piece of evidence (i.e., each study and the Moodie review) is treated as a separate piece of evidence and each needs to be undermined and discredited in turn until no evidence remains that could damage one's client's case. By contrast, in scientific work, it is essential that the extant research is synthesised and greater confidence in the findings established through the cumulative 'weight of the evidence' [75] .\n\n To sum up, the two TTC submissions (by BAT and JTI) and the associated expert reports used different combinations of the techniques of mimicked critique we have documented here to dismiss the entire literature supportive of SP.\n\n As well as dismissing research that supported SP, another, more expansive, strategy in the submissions was to change the evidential landscape within which the policy debate was conducted by introducing and promoting research that examined non-packaging Hammond et al, 2011 [48] : On-line survey of 18-to19-year-old females (smokers and non-smokers) in the US; randomised exposure to different pack designs; rating for appeal and health risk+behavioural pack selection task. Finding: female branded packs associated with glamour, slimness, attractiveness, and less harm compared to plain packs.\n\n Devinney (2012) critique [40] Review of Devinney critique Practices of mimicked scientific critique 'the lack of actual behavioural outcomes or incentive compatible measures that represent how individuals would make choices in the broader context of purchasing are quite serious.' (p. 31)\n\n The complexity of smoking uptake decisions and the fact that, for young people, cigarette packs may be proffered by friends rather than purchased appears not to be recognised. Nor does the fact that the outcomes were based on previous research (including tobacco industry market research) and specifically explore the mechanisms through which packaging (and SP) is likely to impact on smoking behaviour.\n\n Behavioural task was used: respondents were asked which, if any, packs they would like to be sent upon conclusion of the study.\n\n Studying actual cigarette pack purchasing behaviour or any close incentive compatible proxy among young non-smokers (as included in the Hammond study) is likely to be deemed unethical.\n\n 'The ''Male brands'' that are meant as controls have completely different brand names, pack dimensions and colours.' (p. 34)\n\n In line with evidence cited by Devinnney that intentions most closely relate to actual purchasing when they are for existing products (p. 12), brands used are real brands. The reality is that male brands are different from female brands and thus the two cannot be both real and identical.\n\n The above is acknowledged in the paper and for this reason the male brands are excluded from some analyses.\n\n 'The research uses 5-point scales \u2026 these 5-point scales are then arbitrarily aggregated so that they are dichotomous (i.e., ''1'' and ''0'').", "qa": [["60_7596362_7_1", "What are some criticisms of the industry experts' reports in the tobacco litigation model?\n", "Some criticisms of the industry experts' reports in the tobacco litigation model include the fact that they were mainly single-author reports commissioned by tobacco companies and not subject to peer-review.

Effects of C-K on the histopathology of the joints and spleens in CIA mice In CIA mice, synoviocytes proliferated to multiple layers, and the articular cartilage was destroyed and demonstrated inflammatory infiltration. The hyperplastic synovium in CIA mice included a large number of fibroblasts and new blood vessels. In mice treated with C-K (56 mg/kg), articular cartilage destruction and pannus formation were slightly inhibited. C-K (112 mg/kg) significantly reduced articular cartilage destruction, pannus formation, and synovial hyperplasia, although inflammatory cell infiltration was observed to a small extent ( Figure 3A) . The inflammatory scores of the joints in the model mice were increased in comparison with those of normal mice. C-K (56 and 112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) substantially rescued the increase in inflammatory scores observed in CIA mice ( Figure 3B) .\n\n The normal spleen architecture included two major functional zones, the hematogenous red pulp and the lymphoid white pulp. The white pulp was composed of lymphoid follicles and periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths. In the model mice, the white pulp showed proliferation, GC development, and an increase in pathology scores. C-K (56, 112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increased pathology scores when compared with those observed in CIA mice ( Figure 3C ).\n\n The results showed that the T and B lymphocyte proliferation induced by the different stimulators in CIA mice was increased compared with that in normal mice. C-K (28, 56, and 112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) clearly reduced ConAinduced T lymphocyte proliferation ( Figure 4A ). C-K (112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) mildly reduced LPS-induced B lymphocyte proliferation in CIA mice ( Figure 4B ). T lymphocyte proliferation induced by CII in CIA mice was increased compared with that in normal mice. Treatment with C-K (112 mg/kg) or MTX (2 mg/kg) reduced CII-induced T lymphocyte proliferation ( Figure 4C ). These data suggested that C-K primarily affects the function of T cells, but the characteristics and mechanism of C-K's effect need to be elucidated.\n\n The levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, anti-CII antibody, and IL-4 in the joints were determined by ELISA. The results showed that the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 in the joints of CIA mice were increased, whereas the production of IFN-\u03b3 in the joints was decreased. C-K (28, 56, and 112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the expression of TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure  5A ). The concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in C-K-treated (28 and 56 mg/kg) mice was recovered ( Figure 5B ). Treatment with C-K (56 and 112 mg/kg) and MTX (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the concentration of anti-CII antibody ( Figure 5C ). However, neither C-K nor MTX had a clear effect on the level of IL-4 in CIA mice ( Figure 5D ). (Figures 6B and 6F) . The proportion of CD3 + CD4 + Th cells was not affected by C-K or MTX administration ( Figure 6A ).\n\n \n\n The data we obtained indicated that C-K substantially modulated the activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes in CIA mice, which might be a novel mechanism underlying the effects of C-K in the treatment of RA.\n\n Effects of C-K on the expression of CD28, TCR, CTLA-4, and PD-1 in the T lymphocytes of CIA mice The activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes are controlled by the expression of the TCR, CD28, CTLA-4, and PD-1. In this study, the expression of CD28 and the TCR in \n\n Acta Pharmacologica Sinica npg the T lymphocytes of CIA mice increased, whereas the levels of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in T lymphocytes was significantly decreased ( Figure 7A ). Compared with the CIA mice, C-K greatly decreased the expression of CD28 and the TCR, whereas it significantly increased the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 ( Figure 7B ). To verify this result, we used a laser confocal microscope to determine the expression of these important signaling molecules, which are involved in the activation of T lymphocytes.

The hypothesis was that there will be images (associated with a position and a frequency) that provide more information than others. The goal was twofold: on the one hand, to detect the most relevant frequencies/positions and, on the other hand, to reduce the complexity of the system by eliminating those frequencies/positions that provided less information.\n\n At this point, the information that an image provided had to be evaluated not only individually but also collectively to establish which images provided supplementary information. The ultimate goal was to obtain the set of images that allowed us to minimize the EER value associated with the system, taking the corresponding value using the global error as a reference and where all images contributed to unitary weights.\n\n To evaluate the different hypotheses, a weight = 1-to select an image-and a weight = 0-not to select it-were defined.\n\n The following studies were carried out:\n\n (i) system analysis using a single image;\n\n (ii) system analysis using all the images associated with a position;\n\n (iii) system analysis using all the images associated with a frequency;\n\n (iv) system analysis discarding all the images associated with a position;\n\n (v) system analysis discarding all the images associated with a frequency;\n\n (vi) System analysis discarding any images.\n\n The Scientific World Journal \n\n In this case, the individual information-corresponding to a frequency and a positionthat each acoustic image provided to the biometric system was analysed, assuming that the rest of the images were not present. In order to achieve this objective, a unitary weight was assigned to the image that corresponds to the selected position and frequency, while the rest of the images had null weights.\n\n The result was equivalent to a biometric system consisting only of an acoustic image. Calculating the EER value of the system for each of the images, the following results were obtained, as shown in Table 3 . It can be checked that the obtained values for each case were very different, resulting in a minimum value of EER = 16.61, for 2 position (front with arms outstretched) evaluated at frequency 2 (8 kHz) and a maximum value of the EER = 35.66, for 1 position (front) evaluated at frequency 3 (10 kHz). The ratio between EER maximum and minimum values was 2.14.\n\n These results also highlighted that the images associated with position 2 (front with arms outstretched) were the ones that provide the most information and, on the other hand, images associated with position 1 (front) and 3 (back) were those which provide the least information, since they were the columns that had higher EER values.\n\n It became clear that each type of images provided different information and, therefore, it was not reasonable to assign all images the same contribution/weight to the error function.\n\n It was also verified that the EER value for a single acoustic image was far superior to the value obtained when the 16 images were combined with unit weights (EER = 6.22). This indicated that a single image was not enough to constitute a biometric system based on acoustic signatures and that the combination of various frequencies/positions was essential to improve the system performance.\n\n However, when minimizing the complexity of the system, the number of positions and frequencies was a relevant parameter. So, it was of great interest to determine whether the information associated with a position or a frequency provided more or less information than the remaining positions/frequencies. Therefore, the following two sections show the analysis of the performance of the system when using all the images associated with a frequency or a position. \n\n In this case, the joint information of the 4 images associated with a specific position, assuming that the rest of the images were not present, was analysed.
