It was first approved in 1997 for refractory B cell lymphomas and it is increasingly applied for autoimmune diseases. In the realm of kidney transplant, rituximab has been used in combination with plasmapheresis and IVIG to treat antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and to desensitize patients with preformed antibodies for ABO-and/or HLAincompatible kidney transplant [22, 23] .\n\n Induction Therapy\n\n Antibody selection should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of immunologic risk, patient comorbidities, financial burden, and the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical trials comparing different antibody induction in various patient populations and with different maintenance immunosuppression are recently reviewed by the author [2] . The published data remain in line with the 2009 KDIGO guideline [24] . Lymphocytedepleting antibody is recommended for those with high immunologic risk as outlined in the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (sensitized patient, presence of donor specific antibody, ABO incompatibility, high HLA mismatches, DGF, cold ischemia time >24 hours, African-American ethnicity, younger recipient age, older donor age), though it increases the risk of infection and malignancy [24] . For low or moderate risk patients, IL-2R Ab induction reduces the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss without much adverse effects, making its balance favorable in these patients [25] [26] [27] . IL-2R Ab induction should also be used in the high risk patients with other comorbidities (history of malignancy, viral infection with HIV, HBV or HCV, hematological disorder of leucopenia or thrombocytopenia and elderly) that may preclude usage of lymphocyte-depleting antibody safely [28] [29] [30] . Many patients with very low risk (nonsensitized, Caucasian, Asian, well HLA matched, living related donor transplant) may be induced with intrave-nous steroids without using any antibody, as long as combined potent immunosuppressives are kept as maintenance. In these patients, benefits with antibody induction may be too small to outweigh its adverse effects and the financial cost [2, 24, 31] . Clinical comparison trials have not demonstrated any graft or patient survival benefit of using T-cell depleting Ab induction in patients with low immunological risk [2, 24] . Rituximab induction is useful in desensitization protocols for ABO and/or HLA incompatible transplants. Alemtuzumab induction might be more successful for adopting less intensive maintenance protocols. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of unconventional strategy remain to be determined.\n\n \n\n Glucocorticoids have been used for preventing and treating graft rejection since the early 1960s. They have multiple actions. In addition to the nonspecific anti-inflamematory actions, glucocorticoids have critical immunosuppressive effect by blocking T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) derived cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptor to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the translocation of transcription factor AP-1 and NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. Therefore, production of several cytokines (IL-1, 2, 3, 6, TNF-\u03b1, gamma-interferon) are inhibited [32, 33] . Large dose of glucocorticoids can be given in the perioperative period as induction therapy (methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg IV), which is usually followed by oral prednisone 30 to 60 mg/day.

In contrast, low or moderate-risk patients may benefit from IL-2R antibody induction due to reduced rejection rates and graft loss without significant adverse effects.

This is seen in all situations where this hepatic hormone is low (iron-deficient diet, bleeding, hypoxia, types I, II, III hemochromatosis, etc). On the contrary, increased hepcidin (inflammation, infection, exogenic iron overload, liver adenomatosis, etc.) (52) results in decreased intestinal iron absorption and iron retention in RES cells.

Inhaled NO clearly is effective for this indication and reduces the severity of subsequent lung disease and the necessity for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in these infants. Off-label clinical use is widespread, and includes using inhaled NO to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); complications of lung and cardiac transplantation; pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, as well as chronic pulmonary diseases; and to produce desirable direct effects on blood elements, specifically during the treatment of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. 11 Lowson describes several alternatives to inhaled NO, and focuses his review on inhaled prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). Why do we need additional drugs if we have nitric oxide? Expense is only one criterion for drug selection. Efficacy, safety, availability, and ease-of-use are other important considerations.\n\n Efficacy of inhaled NO for its off-label uses has been difficult to demonstrate. Placebo-controlled trials of iNO to treat ARDS have been disappointing, demonstrating only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome. 12, 13 While in many patients inhaled NO provides selective pulmonary vasodilation, large multicenter trials examining the effect of inhaled NO therapy on clinical course and outcome of patients with diverse causes of pulmonary hypertension have not been performed.\n\n Physiologically, it seems reasonable that a selective pulmonary vasodilator might be effective in treating ARDS. Reduced pulmonary capillary pressure should decrease the extent of pulmonary edema; should improve lung compliance; and might speed resolution of lung injury. Improved oxygenation should permit a reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration and airway pressure. But these effects may be insufficient to alter outcome. Usually, pulmonary artery pressure is only modestly elevated in ARDS. Even in severe cases, the mean pulmonary artery pressure is usually about 30 mmHg. 14 This degree of pulmonary hypertension is well tolerated, and few patients with ARDS die of their pulmonary hypertension. Rather, the survival of patients with ARDS appears to depend more on the occurrence of sepsis and multiple organ failure than on blood gas tensions or pulmonary artery pressure. [15] [16] [17] This Editorial View accompanies the following article: Lowson SM: Inhaled alternatives to nitric oxide. ANESTHESIOLOGY 2002; 96:1504 -13.\n\n The effect of iNO varies among patients. Approximately one-third of patients fail to demonstrate improved oxygenation or decreased pulmonary artery pressure. 12, 18 The cause of hyporesponsiveness remains under investigation. We cannot predict which patients may benefit and why pulmonary vasodilation does not occur in others.\n\n Consequently, the search for ways of improving the efficacy of iNO and designing effective alternative therapies continues. Combinations of therapies have been developed that aim to improve the matching of ventilation-to-perfusion or increase the biologic activity of inhaled NO. Alternative therapies have been suggested that may provide equivalent pulmonary vasodilation. While such therapies are attractive, whether they will affect clinical outcome is unknown.\n\n Ventilatory techniques that increase alveolar recruitment, such as the use of high-frequency oscillation in neonates, 7 or prone positioning of ARDS patients, 19 may improve the response to inhaled NO. Recruiting lung volume, by adding PEEP 20 or by the use of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons, 21 has been used to augment the response to iNO. The coadministration of vasoconstrictors, such as almitrine and norepinephrine, may enhance pulmonary vasoconstriction and accentuate the improvement in PaO 2 observed during inhaled NO therapy, presumably by improving the matching of ventilation to perfusion. 22, 23 Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP can also increase the efficacy and duration of action of iNO. 24, 25 Even if efficacy were improved, however, iNO therapy still has several drawbacks. It is expensive, cumbersome devices are necessary to administer the drug safely, and continuous administration is required. Especially for chronic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, therapies that are inexpensive, available in convenient forms (such as a tablet or simple multidose inhaler), and allow for intermittent dosing would be advantageous.\n\n Does inhaled prostacyclin fulfill these goals?", "qa": [["0_1332430_2_1", "What are some off-label uses of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in clinical practice?\n", "Off-label uses of iNO include treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complications of lung and cardiac transplantation, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital and acquired heart disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease."], ["0_1332430_2_2", "What are some factors that contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating the efficacy of iNO for its off-label uses?\n", "Placebo-controlled trials of iNO for off-label uses have been disappointing, showing only transient improvements in oxygenation and no effect on outcome.

One in four women will experience intimate partner violence (IPV), such as physical assault, sexual assault, or stalking, during her lifetime (Coker et al., 2007a (Coker et al., , 2007b Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000) . Although the exact rate is unknown, some women experience breast cancer and IPV simultaneously. Researchers have documented the importance of a positive partner response to a woman's ability to deal with breast cancer (Koopman, Hermanson, Diamond, Angell, & Spiegel, 1998; Manne & Badr, 2008; Manne & Glassman, 2000; Manne et al.; Pistrang & Barker, 1995; Sales, Schulz, & Biegel, 1992) , but little attention has been paid to those who are dealing with breast cancer while in an abusive relationship.\n\n Nearly half of women with breast cancer report changes in their relationships with their partners (Barni & Mondin, 1997) , and some changes in health status, such as pregnancy or the presence of a physical disability, seem to make women more vulnerable to abuse and injury (Curry, Hassouneh-Phillips, & Johnston-Silverberg, 2001; Parker, McFarlane, & Soeken, 1994; Parker, McFarlane, Soeken, Silva, & Reel, 1999) . However, little is known about how IPV and breast cancer interact.\n\n Oncologists Schmidt, Woods, and Stewart (2006) noted multiple reports of IPV from patients in their oncology practice. Although noting the lack of literature on the topic, they posited that patients with cancer, like pregnant women and older patients, are members of a vulnerable population and are, therefore, at higher risk for IPV. They suspected that IPV prevalence is higher in patients with cancer but that practitioners, perhaps because they do not want to believe it happens in their practices, likely believe that the IPV rate is lower. Schmidt et al. noted that patients with cancer can become frail as a result of the disease and treatment effects, therefore increasing dependence on their caregivers as well as becoming at risk for social isolation because of physical changes. They argued that a cancer diagnosis could provide a unique \"provocation of violence\" against a patient with cancer because of the lack of control that the partner has over the cancer, as well as the Research Approach: Qualitative interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of seven women.

All were in relationships with men, and relationship length ranged from 2-29 years ( -X = 12 years).\n\n Methodologic Approach: Each participant had one semistructured qualitative interview.\n\n Experiences of women simultaneously experiencing breast cancer and IPV.\n\n Findings: A number of themes emerged, including: (a) reassessing life, (b) believing that stress from the relationship caused the cancer, (c) valuing support from others, and (d) the significance of the breast.\n\n Conclusions: For all of the participants, the breast cancer diagnosis changed their intimate relationships in some way.

The former approach converges on the primary motility disorder that leads to re\u00afux. 4 The latter, which is currently the option recommended for patients with more severe grades of GERD, is based on elevating gastric pH and decreasing the volume of gastric juice (hence of the re\u00afuxate). 5 Gastric pH can be controlled to some extent with histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H 2 -RAs) and these drugs have been the mainstay of antisecretory therapy in the past. However, with the advent of proton pump inhibitors, the ef\u00aecacy of H 2 -RAs has been overshadowed, particularly in the treatment of patients with GERD. Over 90% of patients with endoscopically SUMMARY Background: Proton pump inhibitors can be effective as maintenance therapy in reducing the relapse rate of re\u00afux oesophagitis at a dose lower than that used for acute healing. Patients and methods: Patients (n 396, 18\u00b188 years old) with healed re\u00afux oesophagitis (grade II or III before healing) were included in this multinational, prospective, parallel-group, randomized double-blind study. They took oral pantoprazole 20 mg (n 203) or 40 mg (n 193), once daily for up to 12 months. Scheduled endoscopies were performed at entry, after 6 and 12 months, or when symptoms of at least moderate intensity were perceived on 3 consecutive days; symptoms were assessed every 3 months. The primary ef\u00aecacy parameter was the time until endoscopically proven relapse of re\u00afux oesophagitis occurred; the secondary parameters included tolerability, safety and time until symptomatic relapse occurred. Results: Analysis was performed using the`all-patientstreated' approach. Endoscopic relapse rates in the 20 mg group after 6 and 12 months were 16 and 29%, respectively; in the 40 mg group, they were 7 and 19%, respectively. Symptomatic relapse rates after 6 and 12 months were 14 and 21% in the 20 mg group and 10 and 17% in the 40 mg group, respectively. Pantoprazole 20 mg and 40 mg were well tolerated throughout the study; the type and frequency of adverse events reported were similar for both treatment groups. Conclusion: The 20 mg dose was proven to be`at least equivalent' to the 40 mg dose with respect to endoscopic and symptomatic relapse. The 20 mg once daily dose represents an effective and safe maintenance regimen for the majority of patients with healed re\u00afux oesophagitis.\n\n diagnosed moderate to severe GERD (grade II or III, Savary\u00b1Miller classi\u00aecation 6 ) can be healed during short-term treatment with a proton pump inhibitor; this compares to about 45% of patients healed following treatment with H 2 -RAs. 7\u00b113 The higher rate of oesophageal healing is probably due to the proton pump inhibitors' successful ability to elevate intragastric pH to higher levels and for a longer duration than the H 2 -RAs. Moreover, proton pump inhibitors are not subject to the development of tolerance\u00d0a well-known disadvantage of H 2 -RAs. 11, 14, 15 Acute re\u00afux oesophagitis can clearly be healed by short-term regimens with antisecretory drugs.

Imatinib uptake was also significantly decreased by incubation with inhibitors of the human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1), and thus may be hOCT1-mediated. 48 The level of hOCT1 mRNA is significantly lower in cytogenetic non-responders, 49, 50 and differential hOCT1 function is a significant determinant of molecular response in imatinib-treated patients. 51 However, the activity of these transporters is still measured primarily for research purposes, and the tests are not widely available.\n\n Pharmacokinetics monitoring is widely used in many other branches of medicine, such as neurology, cardiology and psychiatry, but has not yet been widely applied in clinical oncology practice. Although the supporting data are currently limited, particularly with respect to prospective studies, there are reasonable grounds to consider blood-level testing as an aid to clinical decision making. There are several scenarios in which it could be of value: for example, when patients have a suboptimal response or treatment failure, when adverse reactions are unusually severe, or when the clinician suspects either a drug-drug interaction or that the patient is not adhering to the treatment regimen. If low concentrations are found, it is important to ascertain the underlying cause (for example, poor adherence or drug-drug interactions).\n\n In cases of suboptimal response or treatment failure, measurement of trough plasma imatinib concentration could potentially assist the clinician in deciding whether to escalate the dose. For example, if the imatinib plasma concentration is low, dose escalation could be considered. However, in the absence of prospective trial data clarifying the role of blood-level testing in these patients, dose escalation may still be advisable even when the plasma concentration is not low, if the patient has a suboptimal response and minimal toxicity. High-dose imatinib (800 mg as 400 mg twice daily) has been reported to produce earlier and more molecular and cytogenetic responses than the standard dose of 400 mg daily. 52 There are also several reports of dose escalation being successfully used to overcome resistance to standard-dose therapy in some patients. [53] [54] [55] Plasma concentrations of imatinib should be considered as one of several elements that influence decision making, and results should always be interpreted in the clinical context. Plasma imatinib concentrations in the range associated with a lower probability of response should not by themselves be considered an indication to increase the dose, if a patient is currently responding well to treatment.\n\n Measurement of imatinib plasma concentrations could aid clinical decision making in patients suffering from severe adverse effects, as these may sometimes be associated with high imatinib plasma concentrations. Blasdel et al.\n\n 34 measured plasma imatinib in three patients receiving imatinib 300 mg twice daily, with unusually severe toxicity: grade 3 myalgia, transfusion-dependent erythropoietin-refractory anemia associated with bone-marrow hypoplasia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. They found imatinib concentrations that were considerably higher than expected. In two of the three patients, dose reduction resolved the most troublesome adverse effects, with repeat blood-level testing showing that concentrations were still within the proposed therapeutic range. In the third patient, imatinib was permanently discontinued. However, as this was a very small group of patients, no firm conclusions can be drawn about either the importance of blood-level testing, or the most appropriate treatment decision in patients with severe adverse effects who have elevated plasma imatinib concentrations.\n\n Although there is evidence of a link between imatinib exposure and toxicity in CML, 33 the correlation between plasma imatinib concentrations and adverse events may not be linear. In the IRIS trial, some adverse events were seen more frequently in patients with intermediate or lower plasma concentrations. 15 Decisions regarding the need for treatment interruption, dose reduction, or change of therapy should thus be based on the overall clinical situation.

Diabetic nephropathy represents the major cause of end-stage renal disease in both developed and developing countries and it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 35 Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness in people of working age. This complication can be diagnosed already after five years from the onset of diabetes, and almost all patients will show variable degrees of retinopathy after 20 years of diabetes. 36 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication estimated to affect 30-50% of individuals with diabetes, although clinical symptoms do not generally occur until long after the onset of diabetes. Abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system can also occur in patients with diabetes, with early subclinical manifestations, such as decreased heart rate variability, being detectable within a year of diagnosis in patients with T2D, and within two years in patients with T1D. 37 With regard to macrovascular complications, epidemiologic data indicate that people with diabetes have a two-to fourfold increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which in turn is a key contributor of mortality. 38 \n\n Hyperglycemia contributes to the development of vascular complications through several mechanisms: activation of the polyol and hexosamine pathways, diacylglycerol-protein kinase C (DAG-PKC), increased production of advanced glycation end products (AGE), increased synthesis of growth factors, cytokines, and oxidative stress. 28, 39 The polyol pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular complications through the action of aldose reductase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.\n\n Aldose reductase reduces the aldehyde form of glucose to sorbitol, which is then oxidized to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase and then again enters into glycolysis. In the context of hyperglycemia, the production of sorbitol overcomes the potential of its oxidation, with its consequent accumulation within the cells and dysregulation of the cellular osmotic status, reduction of Na + /K + -ATPase activity, cytosolic increase in NADH/ NAD + , and decrease in NADPH. 28 The hexosamine pathway converts fructose-6-phosphate into N-acetyl glucosamine, which has been implicated in the activation of the transcriptional factor Sp1, leading to increased synthesis of factors, such as transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u00df1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which in turn are associated to the development of vascular complications. In addition, the hexosamine pathway is also associated with increased oxidative stress and the effects of the activation of this pathway can be prevented by overexpression of antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase. Hyperglycemia can also stimulate de novo synthesis of DAG, followed by the activation of PKC, which in turn modulates the activity of various enzymes, including phospholipase A2, Na + /K + -ATPase, as well as the expression of genes related to components of the extracellular matrix. 28 AGEs have been implicated in several biologic activities, mostly by binding to the AGE-specific receptors (RAGEs) on many cells. In particular, they can induce oxidative stress and release of cytokines and growth factors, which in turn accelerate chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. \n\n The DCCT studied a cohort of 1,441 subjects, aged 13-39 years, with T1D for 1-15 years 42 by comparing intensive (insulin administered three or more times daily by injection or an external pump) versus conventional (one or two daily insulin injections) insulin therapy.

At postnatal day 14, hyperoxia decreases RAC. rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia increases RAC to levels similar to those seen in animals raised in room air. At postnatal day 21, after 7 days of recovery in room air, RAC remain decreased in the hyperoxia-exposed animals. At day 21 RAC are increased to control values in animals exposed to hyperoxia and treated with rhVEGF during the first 14 days of life. C: effects of rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia on mean linear intercepts (MLI) in infant rats. At postnatal day 14, hyperoxia increases MLI, but rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia decreases MLI to levels similar to room air controls. At postnatal day 21, after 7 days of recovery in room air, MLI remain increased in the hyperoxia-exposed animals. At day 21, MLI are decreased to control values in animals exposed to hyperoxia and treated with rhVEGF during the first 14 days of life.\n\n Western blot analysis of eNOS protein was performed to determine the effects of hyperoxia and rhVEGF treatment on eNOS expression. As shown in Fig. 6A , rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia significantly increases the eNOS-to-\u2424-actin ratio on postnatal day 3 (2.49 \u03ee 0.68 vs. 0.77 \u03ee 0.20, P \u03fd 0.05). At postnatal days 14 and 21, lung eNOS expression in hyperoxia-exposed animals treated with rhVEGF was not different from animals exposed to hyperoxia alone (1.0 \u03ee 0.1 vs. 0.8 \u03ee 0.1, P \u03ed NS) and (0.6 \u03ee 0.1 vs. 1.0 \u03ee 0.1, P \u03ed NS).\n\n Immunostaining with eNOS was also performed to determine effects of hyperoxia and rhVEGF treatment on localization. As shown in Fig. 4B , eNOS is localized to endothelial cells and airway epithelial cells. There appears to be no difference in localization in 3-day-old and 14-day-old rat pups exposed to hyperoxia and treated with rhVEGF compared with rat pups of the same age exposed to hyperoxia alone.\n\n We found that exposure of infant rats to hyperoxia increases lung edema and impairs distal lung growth. These changes persist despite prolonged recovery in room air. We further report that treatment with rhVEGF protein during hyperoxia exposure worsens lung edema early, as demonstrated by increased lung wet-to-dry ratios at postnatal day 3. However, rhVEGF treatment improves late lung architecture, as shown by increased septation and increased vessel density. We also show that rhVEGF treatment of infant rats during hyperoxia exposure preserves eNOS protein levels in the lung. Overall, these findings demonstrate that rhVEGF treatment transiently worsens lung edema during neonatal hyperoxia but preserves lung growth and structure.\n\n These findings further support the hypothesis that VEGF regulates angiogenesis and promotes lung growth and that arrested alveolarization after neonatal hyperoxia may be due to Fig. 4 .

[1] Rituximab is a novel therapeutic agent for severe and recalcitrant PV. [2, 3] It is now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first-line drug for adult patients with moderate-to-severe form PV. [4] It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which is directed against mature B-lymphocytes that are responsible for antibody production. Toxicities related to rituximab include infusion reactions and delayed reactions. Delayed reactions include Type III hypersensitivity reaction known as serum sickness which can be seen 10-14 days after the first dose of rituximab. Rituximab-induced serum sickness (RISS) has been reported earlier in connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and hematological malignancies.

He was put on tablet prednisolone 40 mg/day in divided doses. The patient was advised about the rituximab intravenous infusion following modified lymphoma protocol, [7] and accordingly, preliminary investigations were done including complete blood count (CBC), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), urine complete examination, viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, electrocardiography, two-dimensional echocardiography, Mantoux test, X-ray chest, and abdominal ultrasonography. All investigations were within normal limits. In the intensive care unit setting and under strict observation, premedication with intravenous hydrocortisone, pheniramine maleate, and tablet paracetamol was done followed by infusion of 500 mg of rituximab in 500 ml of 5% dextrose solution over 4-6 h. The first infusion was uneventful. The follow-up was done on the 3 rd day with routine CBC, LFT, RFT, and urine complete examination which was within normal limits. Similar infusions were given weekly for total six infusions, and tablet prednisolone was tapered gradually to 10 mg/day. All infusions were uneventful, and all the lesions healed completely [ Figure 2 ]. At 10 days later the last (6 th ) infusion of rituximab, the patient developed a high-grade fever along with epigastric pain and vomiting. Two days later, he developed pain and swelling of both knee joints and redness of eyes. On examination, he had severe epigastric tenderness, diffuse nontender edema of bilateral knee joints [ Figure 3] , and bilateral conjunctival congestion [ Figure 4a and b]. There was no skin rash and lymphadenopathy. X-ray knee joints showed soft-tissue swelling probably due to effusion in the joint which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging study of both knee joints. Acute-phase reactants, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated. All other routine investigations including CBC, RFT, LFT, and urine complete examination were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography was not significant.

Wang 1 *, Y.H. Qiu 2 . 1 Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing 400067, China, 2 West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China Background: A hordeolum or stye is an acute purulent inflammation of meibomian glands or hair follicles of the eyelashes. Staphylococcus aureus is the main cause of cases of hordeolum. A hordeolum usually appears painful, erythematous, inflammatory, mattery and localized of the lid. So it is important to tailor corresponding treatment according to the situation of patients. Methods: No treatment is often necessary. Most styes burst and the tiny amount of pus drains away leaving no further problem. Additional treatment is for serious hordeolum which couldn't be cured by themselves, such as needle therapy, Bloodletting in Apex Conchae Auris, surgical drainage and adjunctive therapy with Chinese and western medicine. Needle therapy is efficient and recovery rate is above 90%. Ear bloodletting therapy is to squeeze about 10 drops of blood and clear with cotton bud. Surgical drainage and adjunctive therapy is a safe, quick way relatively. After operation children should take anticatarrhals and eye drops to have replacement therapy. Results: To have surgical drainage and adjunctive therapy aimed at children: first give 3 to 5 drops of anaesthetic to eyes. Use operating forceps to open lids quickly and prick sore to drain pus, and then cut swollen area with surgical scissors. Take medicine to have replacement therapy after operation: drops of Tobramycin ophthalmic, ophthalmic gel of levofloxacin, amoxicillin and sulbactam pivoxil chewable tablets. This surgical drainage and adjunctive therapy have a desired effect. Conclusion: A child who develops one stye may have frequent recurrences. So it is important to take care of hygiene. Take Bloodletting in Apex Conchae Auris or Chinese medicine for early stage of patients. Administering Chinese medicine orally can get the effect of removing heat, reducing swelling and ease pain. As for midanaphase, it should take surgical drainage and adjunctive therapy with medicine to recovery.\n\n South-East Asian children Since malnourishment is also an ongoing health challenge, the study aim was to compare the disease pattern and complications of measles among well-fed and malnourished babies. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Pediatric department of Roshan Medical Center, Fateh Jang, Pakistan for a period of 6 months from January 2009 to July 2009. A total of 110 babies were recruited. 67% (n = 74) were males, mean age 19 months. Measles was made as a confirmed diagnosis by using World Health Organization guidelines. All the subjects were divided in to wellnourished and malnourished groups using Gomez formula for malnourishment among children. All were evaluated for complications of measles by clinical history, physical examination and appropriate investigations. Complications taken in to consideration were diarrhea, encephalitis, pneumonia, otitis media, thrombocytopenia and corneal ulceration. Results: 60 (66%) patients were well-nourished and 50 (44%) were malnourished. Pneumonia 36% (n = 22) vs 68% (n = 34), diarrhea 29% (n = 17) vs 62% (n = 31), encephalitis 16% (n = 10) vs 26% (n = 13) and corneal ulceration 4% (n = 2) vs 9% (n = 4 to 5) was present among well nourished and malnourished babies respectively. Thrombocytopenia and otitis media was present in 2% in each group. Conclusion: Complications of measles are more frequent among children with malnourished state. Although national vaccination programs against measles have proven much better results in terms of preventing the complicated disease form, but still the ongoing malnourishment has aggravated the complications of this viral disease and efforts should be made to eradicate this worldwide problem of malnourishment among children especially in Asia and Africa. Results: Typical symptoms among the patients were fever, vomiting, headache and seizures. CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of brain abscess and the most frequent location was parietal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere with a diameter more than 1.5 cm.

This agrees with findings of elevated serum levels of IL-1b in American cement masons, whose major exposure is to cement aerosol. 28 IL-1b upregulates the adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and neutrophils and thereby contributes to the accumulation of neutrophils in the airways. 19 Even though the neutrophil counts decreased after 5 days without exposure, the IL-1b concentration did not decline during this time in the exposed workers. This could indicate that longer avoidance of exposure to cement aerosol is needed to normalise the sputum concentration of IL-1b.\n\n The similar concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in the three groups suggest a low response of these inflammatory markers. IL-6 is a common inflammatory marker that may be activated by several stimuli. IL-6 increases during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and appears to be useful in evaluating the intensity of the disease, 29 and a low level of this cytokine is expected in healthy subjects. IL-8 has a chemotactic effect on neutrophils and is negatively correlated with lung function in patients with COPD, 30 suggesting that the low IL-8 concentrations reflected relatively low-grade neutrophilic activation in these healthy subjects with normal spirometric values.\n\n To our knowledge, no studies have reported on biological materials from the airways of cement aerosol-exposed workers. One report recently showed decreased phagocytic activity in blood neutrophils stimulated with a stimulant of reactive oxygen species in cement mill workers compared with controls. 31 However, information about the exposure, inflammatory cells and soluble markers was not given, and it is difficult to compare our data with this other report. A study of healthy iron ore miners in Sweden found changes in inflammatory cells and soluble markers in induced sputum similar to those in our study. 22 In these iron ore miners, increased levels of neutrophils, macrophages, fibronectin, metalloproteinase-9 and IL-10 were associated with exposure to dust and diesel exhaust. Although these variables did not differ between the exposed and nonexposed periods in the miners, the miners showed signs of airway inflammation compared with an external reference group.\n\n When workers are used as their own controls, selection bias is probably less important. 32 However, it is possible that individuals who are susceptible to adverse effects from cement aerosol could have departed the cement industry, leaving only robust subjects in the workforce to be included in the study. If so, we would have underestimated the inflammatory effects. Despite differences in the percentage of neutrophils between the exposed and unexposed periods within the same worker, it is possible that a greater decline would have occurred if avoidance of exposure had been sustained. The exposed workers were included from 2005 to 2007. There were no reports of technical changes or differences in working routines, ventilation or use of protective equipment during this period. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the exposure had changed between sputum sampling and air measurement of the thoracic samples 2 years later. The same investigator performed sputum induction in both production workers and controls under similar conditions throughout the study period.\n\n Confounders that may not be controlled adequately or adjusted for in the analysis could include unknown differences in socioeconomic factors or respiratory irritants outside the workplace, especially when comparing the exposed group and the external reference group.\n\n DTTwas used to dissolve the sputum plugs. DTT may change the native structure of the proteins because it reduces the protein disulfide bonds, and this may affect measurement of cytokine concentration in induced sputum. However, DTT was added to all samples as well as to the standard samples used to generate the standard curve, and all samples were processed similarly. Thus, the relative differences between periods and groups are unlikely to have been affected by inclusion of DTT.\n\n As well as measuring respirable aerosol concentration, we also measured the thoracic fraction of airborne cement particles in exposed workers. The thoracic fraction represents the aerosol that reaches the airways below the larynx and includes the respirable fractions that contain particles small enough to reach the alveoli. Induced sputum contains cells and fluid from the large central respiratory sections below the larynx. 33 Considering this, both fractions of the aerosol are of interest when studying changes in induced sputum samples.\n\n Levels of inflammatory cells and markers from the exposed tests were thought to reflect recent exposure.", "qa": [["41_8016078_4_1", "What are the potential health risks associated with exposure to cement aerosol?\n", "Exposure to cement aerosol can lead to increased levels of inflammatory cells and markers in the airways.

However, the relationships between VEGF expression and COX-2 and MMP expression in PTC have not been reported previously.\n\n The aim of the present study was to compare the immunohistochemical levels of COX-2, MMP-9 and VEGF proteins in specimens of PTC with those in specimens of benign thyroid tumours.

Of these, 23 patients (36 feet; 3.2%) developed a rocker bottom deformity ( Fig. 1) and were further analysed.\n\n Standard conservative treatment for clubfoot deformity. All feet were initially treated by manipulation, muscular stimulation of the dorsolateral aspect of the foot, and fixation of the foot on a rigid plastic plate fixed to the plantar aspect of the foot with a non-elastic strapping, followed by immobilisation in an above-knee splint, with the knee in 90\u00b0 flexion and the ankle in a neutral position, until six months of age. 8 Between the age of six months and one year, the patients had a below-knee posterior splint applied during the day, and an above-knee posterior splint during the night. Once walking age was reached, an above-knee splint was used only during the night. Methods of evaluation. The severity of the foot deformity at birth was evaluated using the Dimeglio score 14 first published in 1995. For most patients, this score has been applied retrospectively, using photographs taken prior to commencing any treatment showing the extent of the deformity in the three anatomical planes, and with the assistance of a trained physiotherapist.\n\n The final result was assessed using the Ghanem and Seringe score 15 which has 100 points available. As rocker bottom deformity is a sagittal deformity the results have focused on the sagittal plane. Dorsiflexion of the foot relative to the leg was estimated. Lateral radiographs were evaluated at the onset of treatment, and at one, four and six months of age with the foot held with maximum correction. Once the child was walking, radiographs were obtained in the standing position. Radiological measurements included the tibiocalcaneal, calcaneo-fifth metatarsal and talo-first metatarsal angles (Fig. 2a) . Dorsal calcaneocuboid subluxation was quantified as a percentage of the vertical displacement of the cuboid relative to its height (Fig. 2b) .\n\n Intra-and interobserver reliability was examined by repeating the measurements after a three-week interval. For the first observer, the intra-observer assessment was r = -0.81 and for the second, r = 0.79. The interobserver reliability was also good with r = 0.76 and r = 0.77 for the two observers respectively. Statistical analysis.

Written informed consent was obtained from participants ( patients and carers) prior to interview. Semistructured interviews were conducted in participants' own homes. AG was aware of the influence that personal characteristics of the interviewer may have on the collection and interpretation of qualitative data. 23 She was open with participants about her role as an academic GP trainee and emphasised her independence from the NHRPP.\n\n A topic guide was developed from the literature and in discussion with the study team. Broad headings were used to allow flexibility to explore issues in depth with participants and for questions to evolve as new themes emerged (see online supplementary appendix 1). All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by an external transcription agency. All transcripts were checked by AG and anonymised prior to analysis, and stored securely at Newcastle University. \n\n Transcripts were analysed after each interview using thematic analysis. 24 Thematic analysis was chosen because it offers flexibility, can summarise key features of a large data set while also offering 'thick description' and allow for social as well as psychological interpretation of the data. 24 All transcripts were read by the research team to gain familiarity with the data and then a coding framework was developed and built on as the team worked through the data set. Themes and subthemes were generated led by AG and CD, and refined in team meetings, where deviant cases were also identified. NVivo (V.10) software was used for data management. In the Results section, PT signifies quotes from patients and C from carers, with patient and carer numbers corresponding.\n\n Members of the research team had diverse backgrounds representing primary care, secondary care and social care. Two members were academic GP trainees (AG and TG), one was a GP (LR), one a secondary care rheumatologist (RD) and one a qualified social worker and chartered psychologist (CD). The team were conscious of their personal and professional biases and reflected throughout data collection and analysis to improve the credibility of the data.\n\n \n\n A total of 23 participants took part in the study; 16 patients and 7 family members. Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients participating. The majority of participants were women; 11 patients and 6 family members. Patients were aged between 48 and 90 (median age 81.5 years). A total of 11 patient participants lived alone and 5 lived with a spouse. Four main themes emerged from the data: awareness and understanding of the NHRPP, confidence in the primary healthcare team, limitations of home care and the active role of being a patient.\n\n Awareness and understanding of the NHRPP Awareness of the NHRPP was generally low with some participants appearing completely unaware of the programme, while others remembered receiving a letter informing them they were enrolled on the programme but remembered few details. None of the participants could remember receiving an explicit verbal explanation of the programme and its aims from a healthcare professional. However, some recognised that some elements of their care had changed, for example, being appointed a named GP, the GP visiting them to write care plans, being invited into the surgery to review care plans or being informed about the multidisciplinary meeting where the primary care team discussed their care. Although participants did not have indepth knowledge of the programme, they were able to discuss their perceptions of the programme and their experience of current care (which itself is the NHRPP). In general, participants were positive about the programme and what they perceived to be its broad objective to provide older people with more care at home and to improve the coordination of services. Many participants thought the programme made sense in that it aimed to support them, or their family member at home and this was in line with their views and wishes.\n\n Well, it sounds a good idea but I don't think that the [GP practice] could do anymore. (PT15) I don't want to be in a hospital ward, you know, however nice the people are. You want to keep people in society, not in boxes in some hospital or other. (PT06)\n\n Other participants thought a desire to provide services in a more cost-effective way was the motivation behind the programme and polar opposite views were shared on this perception. This was interpreted positively, as being 'economical' and advantageous to themselves and negatively as being just about reducing costs regardless of the impact on patient care. C06 I can see the advantages to the NHS if they pursue this, and obviously if there are advantages to the NHS, in a matter of speaking that's huge advantages to us. I feel like they're looking after us\u2026.

Daniel coined the term the \"asymmetric developmentally deviated nose\" (ADDN) to emphasize the role of asymmetry and development in the etiology of the problem. 12 Vuyk pointed out that the crooked nose often exists on the asymmetric face, and these asymmetries can come in multiple patterns. 13 Based on this review, it is obvious that there is a distinct continuum between the crooked and the asymmetric nose. The term crooked is defined as bent, curved, or twisted out of shape or out of place. In contrast, the term asymmetric refers to having two sides or halves that are not the same. Thus, the surgeon approaches the crooked nose with a goal of restoring the nose to its original shape and position. In contrast, the surgeon must approach the asymmetric nose with the understanding that the problem is even more complex and that two sides of the nose have never been symmetrical. Thus, the surgical objective is not restoration, but rather creation of a more attractive, symmetrical nose. Essentially, everything that contributes to the crooked nose-osseocartilaginous vaults, septal deviation, etc.-is further compounded in ADDN by asymmetry in all components of the nose and even the face. This article approaches the problem of the asymmetric nose from the perspective of the patient seeking a cosmetic rhinoplasty.\n\n A thorough nasal history is important with emphasis on prior trauma, medical conditions, and previous surgical treatment.\n\n A standard consultation sequence is as follows: (1) the patient is asked what three things bother him or her the most about his or her nose, (2) the external nose is examined from all four views, (3) the internal nose is examined before and after decongestant spray, including air flow through each nostril on deep inspiration, and (4) the findings are recorded and explained to the patient. Endoscopy can be added as necessary. Photographs are taken in four standard views plus additional partial head-up, partial head-down, and topdown (helicopter) views. The reality of nasal and facial asymmetry within the context of embryology and development is explained to the patient.\n\n In our practice, the extent of asymmetry is recorded on the consent page. It is our conclusion that more than 98% of patients have a face with a strong right side and weak left side, with the right nasal bone being convex and the left nasal bone being concave. In the majority of cases, the facial midline is deviated to the right. As regards the nasal and facial deviations, there are two possible deformities: the nasal and facial midlines are deviated to the same side (ipsilateral) or to opposite sides (contralateral). We have found that the partial head-down view best illustrates the severity of septal deviation, while the partial head-up view best illustrates asymmetry of the bony vault and that of the maxilla (\u25baFig. 1). The topdown or \"helicopter\" view reveals the complexity of the problem, especially if the forehead is used as a horizontal and midline reference.\n\n The more severe the asymmetry, the more valuable a computed tomography (CT) scan of the face with threedimensional reformation becomes. 14 With these scans, several measurements can be taken to measure the finite asymmetries from the midline, including upper and lower width of the pyriform aperture, differences in height of the maxillae, ANS deviation, and dental deviation. The analyze tool is used to measure linear and angular distance. In addition, bony and soft tissue landmarks can be evaluated. 15 CT scans allow the surgeon to define the preexisting nasal and facial midlines as well as to decide where the postoperative midline should be. For example, in certain cases, the asymmetry of the nose can be complicated by rotational deformities of the maxilla with the ANS deviated 10 mm and the caudal septum deviated 14 mm from the desired facial midline (\u25baFig. 2). Operative planning is recorded throughout the examination process.\n\n The following is our comprehensive approach and treatment plan for managing a patient with ADDN.", "qa": [["40_2803522_1_1", "What are some surgical techniques used to correct asymmetry in the nose?", "Columellar struts, tip suturing techniques, and excision of both medial and lateral crura have been used to correct asymmetry in the nose."], ["40_2803522_1_2", "How does the surgeon approach the crooked nose compared to the asymmetric nose?", "The surgeon approaches the crooked nose with the goal of restoring the nose to its original shape and position.

It has a female predilection and is usually asymptomatic and detected during middle age [1] . It is usually located in the presacral space and seen as a discrete and well-defined mass of variable attenuation on computed tomography (CT) depending on its contents. Cyst wall calcification may be seen. Rarely, a tailgut cyst may be complicated by infection or malignant transformation [2] [3] [4] .\n\n Hydatid disease is a zoonotic parasitic disease. Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis are the two main infectious causative agents. Although liver and lung are the most commonly affected organs, hydatid cysts have the potential to affect any part of the human body. Primary extrahepatic hydatid cysts have been reported in different organs and anatomical locations and generally pose a diagnostic challenge [5, 6] . There are few reported cases of hydatid disease involving the perineal region [7] [8] [9] . We present the multimodality imaging findings of a retrorectal/presacral tailgut cyst with concomitant hydatid disease of the perineum.\n\n A 32-year-old male patient with a history of poliomyelitis in childhood complained of a progressively enlarging painless deep perianal mass for 1 year with a history of intermittent chronic constipation. The patient was referred to a tertiary healthcare center as a possible case of retroperitoneal sarcoma. Routine contrast enhanced CT showed a large (7.2 \u00d7 7.9 \u00d7 15.5 cm) multilocular, hypoattenuating, retrorectal cystic lesion. It displaced the rectum and rectosigmoid anteriorly and had no relation with the prostate, seminal vesicles, or adjacent major vessels. The CT also revealed a collection of smaller contiguous cysts in the left ischioanal fossa and the left perineal subcutaneous fat. This collection of cysts paralleled and was adjacent to the left puborectalis muscle and breached the left levator ani. No other lesion was found in the abdominal cavity. Atrophy of the right hemipelvis and proximal thigh muscles was related to the history of poliomyelitis ( Figure 1 ). An 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scan was performed and showed no abnormal uptake in these lesions; no regional lymphadenopathy or distant metastases were seen ( Figure 2 ).\n\n Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The retrorectal mass showed intermediate signal intensity on both T1 and T2 with multiple internal T1 hypointense foci and T2 hyperintense foci. The left ischioanal fossa collection of cysts showed low T1 and high T2 signal intensity with multiple internal cysts and T2 and T1 hypointense rim. There was thin peripheral enhancement with no enhancing mural solid component. There was no osseous involvement ( Figure 3 ).\n\n The patient underwent surgical resection. The histopathologic examination of the resected retrorectal cyst revealed a benign tailgut cyst. The resected left ischioanal and gluteal cystic lesions showed an outer histiocytic reaction to a hydatid cyst.\n\n The unique feature of this primary extrahepatic hydatid cyst is its very unusual location in the ischioanal fossa with extension to the left perianal and gluteal areas. While the hydatid cysts had increased signal on T2-weighted images, the tailgut cyst had intermediate signal, denoting proteinaceous or mucinous content. The presence of both a perineal hydatid cyst and tailgut cyst with differing signal characteristics on MRI in a contiguous location in one patient imposed a diagnostic challenge where the added information of MRI proved very useful. In fact, the interpreting radiologist suggested a developmental lesion such as a tailgut cyst and atypical hydatid disease. The differential diagnosis might include a myxoid tumor such as myxoid neurofibroma or aggressive angiomyxoma due to the presence of myxoid, proteinaceous, or mucinous contents. However, the lack of an enhancing solid component makes those diagnoses less likely.\n\n A tailgut cyst is a rare developmental lesion that is a remnant of the embryonic tailgut.
